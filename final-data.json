        "content": "again good afternoon to all of you thank you to the organizing committee and akram for the policy times thank you for the moderated session i think from today morning we are listening to all the vibrant speakers from the government sector and private sector a lot of discussion isn't happening so coming back directly to this point if you see the apr has already started from 2,080 at least in plastic waste but the momentum has been speed up in the last 2 3 years a lot of policies lot of changes in the regulations and why this happened this happened because this is the made up this hour then it is declared that by 2070 it will be net 0 so we have to be less carbon footprint in the environment so that it will reduce the climate change on that background all initiatives has been started in various sector and this epr when i'm talking about epr and plastic waste this is one of the most important sector where the relation has come in the 2 to 3 years if you see minister of environment and forests with collaboration of central pollution control board and state pollution control board a lot of amendments has been done peoples producers recyclers manufacturers everything just giving you a very slow data you know by 2021 to see the cpcb portal only 321 registered pos on the portal but today if you see the cpcv total it's more than 5,000 that means the things has been changed because the policy has been reversed the industry if you see the 3 to 4 years 5 years back only the big industries doing the recycling now every industry has come forward to do the recycling it is not done in a voluntary way it is done because of the regulations so when the regulation has done various things changes in policy things first they're giving importance on the epr part now today is the recycling gate and the coming from 2024 and 25 if you ask they are mostly focused on recycling recycling content these are any things which will come into topic just i'm narrating these points and i'll pass on them by that will give an emphasis that again the main target is the carbon less up less carbon through paint for that you have to more recycle recycling contain and if you see the targets which are set by verbit from 2024 and 25 30 10 and 5 recycle contained in all the 3 categories and recycling percent is in all 3 4 categories 50 30 30 and 50 why it is happening by 2030 and 32 it will everything will be recycled from if recycle contained by 2,040 all category will be recycled from that means it is gives a leverage for the reduction of the carbon footprint we achieved that indian target in 2070 net 0 these are the initiatives which has been taken yes but a lot when the new things has happened there are such something which has been that is a pros and cons to it but definitely i can say it's a continuous improvement and the way india is moving as a nation it is not only showing as a green and cleaner environment to the nation but it shows a good image on the global platform i think it is the one of the great initiative which was taken by india and this is the summary just i want to put forward and next discussion whenever any things will come we'll focus on more that more to that",

        "name": "US-INDIA COLLABORATION AN OUTLOOK FOR 2023",
        "content": "it's just you know beautiful day in the united states and depending on where you are it's either rainy overcast or we're definitely solving our drought problem so what i'd like to do is just kinda go over a brief overview of our agenda today so we're going to explore with the world trade center of utah with david kalback and also with jonathan bench and we're going to look at some of the aspects of what it would mean to relocate to utah and the value proposition for indian companies also jonathan will kind of address some of the legalities about locating to the united states as well as how does that affect your executive team and in addition to that we also have lieutenant general krishnan and he is going to talk about economics and also the importance of indian company expansion so before i hand it off to guru i'd like to show you a video that we have just completed and give you a little bit more background about indus international research foundation and and truly what we are all about indus international research foundation is a global think tank with its physical presence in india it is a global network of scholars who represent and based in various countries in the alliance in fact that the international problems to the yes loss america is committed to us between the people academics enterprise and businesses of the 2 democracies to join hands for a better world and a better tomorrow it also tries to bring the people of 2 countries together true to its motive the irf aims to provide form to the voices from all parties geographies and gender who question dominant narratives it is this plurality of thought so unique to indian tradition that irs seeks to carry abroad while simultaneously bringing contemporary global debates to india if mankind is to survive as a civil society there is no alternative other than to share the resources of the universe equitably for the benefit of all iirs believes in the indian wisdom contained in vedas that says nature is the sole owner of all the treasure of this universe and there is enough for every so that gives you a little bit of perspective when it comes to how india's indus research is leveraging the 1,000,000 of years of ancient philosophy to kind of live their life and help spread that between the two democracies so with that guru i'm gonna hand it off to you thank you thank you mary good morning everyone in the us and good evening in india and it's time for me to bring in colonel vijay the founding president of indus international research foundation and he needs no introduction the marketing president personality for those of you who are meeting him for the first time especially folks from us current vijay has had an exemplary background it's a rare combination of academics military leadership and and several other you know feathers to his cap it's hard to do justice to his profile in in one zoom meeting we should have a separate zoom call for a discussion of his profile so i'll bring in karol vijay please welcome and what are your thoughts on the first webinar in 2023 from irf guru first of all are they audible you're audible yes okay good evening ladies and gentlemen and good morning to all our friends in the us on behalf of i welcome you all to this webinar and wish you all a very happy new year i extend my warm invitation to our special guest both from the us and india i doubt it my apologies i'm not visible on the camera there's some problem of bandwidth hopefully you're all looking good and i wish i could show myself as good unfortunately there's a little i'm a problem i'll i am trying to check soon i begin i also welcome general lieutenant general in case he joined us he's been a great inspiration and he is the one who sowed the seeds of starting the think tank so he he he he's a very respected figure in indian military circles he's been coming out of national defense college and be the great motivator and if time permitting i'll request guru at the end to get his views on this webinar now i begin on a note of a word of caution i know that the world's oldest and largest democracies but we are also 2 sovereign and independent nations guided by our philosophies and beliefs whereas us governance is based on law and justice in india guided by law based on and customs when 2 entities collaborate it's imperative that they both benefit mutually it has to be on the win win principle the indo use collaboration is a vast canvas some of the areas where there's great potential are trade defense space education agriculture industries and health i can go on the list can be endless india with a large population is a huge consumer market it's only from the beginning of this millennium that india relations has begun to warm up relations between the two countries have generally been good though occasional hiccups do occur this can be attributed to cultural and lifestyle differences collaboration can be in the areas where there are convergence of ideas there are 3 levels to my mind of collaboration these are state to state that's at the government level between the industries and businesses and lastly people to people central relations between governments are essential for trade and business to flourish though the inter us relations have been cordial and warm there are times when some confusing signals on political issues have caused delays in the path of progress unless both sides understand each other's sensibilities at all levels these collaborations may not yield their full potential india is fast changing there's a massive infrastructure development villages are turning into towns and towns into city is the fastest developing nation at a time when the whole world is facing economic crisis in terms of ease of doing business india vastly improved its position attracting foreign direct investment and location of manufacturing hubs during the last 8 years india has made rapid progress in all fields and fast emerging as a regional superpower today india is focusing on self reliance and ramping up the infrastructure needed to boost economy in order to sustain the momentum of such initiatives we need to conduct more webinars of this time i congratulate mister guru soule and his team i wish them all success the proceedings of this webinar may be documented so that we have a record of this important event which can act as a stepping stone for future webinars i thank all the guest speakers and the viewers for taking their time off to attend this event before i leave i wish to share a small information this year we have come out with the very soon our first yearbook is about to be released and it has articles from one of the finest minds on geopolitics strategy foreign traditions and so on and the initial reaction and response to this has been very encouraging please share this very shortly we'll be putting it out on our website i once again thank you all for taking your sunday off some people your sunday has just started we in india are at it's not sunday i we it's almost the monday evening today so i wish you all the best and thank you very much once again guru and his team for inviting me to give this in our in our mister guru you're muted guru please unmute yourself let's see let's see guru if i can help you with that while we're fixing that i like to take a moment to interviews david karlback he is the chief operating officer and the managing director for the world trade center in utah he is leading utah and building utah's capacity for international expansion and they have been extremely successful in attracting companies to utah utah i have to tell you i've been there myself it's absolutely a breathtaking state and the people are kind and wonderful and it has it's a wonderful and safe place they have great education school system and david is taking the lead and spreading that message about world trade center utah and its ability to help businesses expand if you will adopters of of of india as a as a site to support our goldman's business i was i was working in hyderabad and then in bangalore as early as 2002 at the very beginning of the business process outsourcing wave in india and and was a close partner to to my colleagues my goldman sachs colleagues in bangalore over the last 2 decades and in any case it was it was a great experience and and i'm a huge fan but i'm also a fan of my state the state of utah and in fact at goldman we worked extremely collaboratively being 11 and a half hours apart we kind of passed the book around the globe often from india to utah and utah back to india and it was a great partnership at goldman and i think it's something hopefully many of you will consider so where is utah we're right there in the middle of the west and we're gonna say more about that but as as ml said is a is a is a great state for lots of reasons and i'm gonna get into that one of which is that we're so centrally located in the western united states and so with easy access to denver la san francisco seattle west coast ports oakland long beach etcetera alright i'm gonna get into details now so as ml suggested utah is a very strong state i'd like to say probably the greatest state in the united states that many of you has never heard of you has never heard of we get accolades for all kinds of things many of them are listed or several of them are listed here we often are ranked to have the best economy to have some of the cities with the best performance to be a standout in entrepreneurship we also have the lowest income gap we for example coming out covid 19 we're the 1st state to show growth again we have the some of the the fastest broadband speeds in the west western us and on and on and on so just you know big headline is utah is a great state for doing business in the united states and if a company is not considering it they're really missing an opportunity a little bit more about the state i already showed you where it is in the in the bigger map here it is it's it's dominated by the rocky mountains and the great salt lake which add to its natural beauty while it's a relatively large state it's it's got a relatively small population especially by indian standards we have 3,300,000 people we are the youngest state in the country with a median age of 31 which i suspect compares favorably to india i know it compares favorably to many of the frontier countries even in africa it's a young state our annual growth rate of population is 1.8% so a good steady growth often through organic growth but in recent years due to inward migration especially in the post covid environment we're seeing lots of residents coming from from surrounding states for example california our economy is is strong and growing fast but it's not huge it's $200,000,000,000 comparable to iraq or new zealand we have 84,000 employer establishments you can see in terms of size we're relatively large 13th largest we though are dominated by national parks monuments and state parks over 70% of the state is park and as i said earlier we're well located to access cities across the west we're 800 miles from san francisco 700 miles from la 500 miles from denver and while you might wanna be located in a capital like that or a major city like that of course that means you're gonna have to to access other markets travel further we think we're well positioned if you don't need to be in the primary market we we have great access to many markets and we're gonna say more about transportation in a second in terms of culture our motto is the beehive escape industrious like bees we're also home to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints 62% of the state are members of that religion and and it has many a and so it's a it's a extremely tolerant and welcoming state very experienced used to even interested in engaging with the world we're home to the greatest snow on earth with huge amounts of powder snow in the mountains within 30 to 40 minutes of downtown salt lake city and there are over a 120 languages spoken in utah indeed because so many church members travel when they graduate from high school they travel for 2 years and they learn the local language where they're where they're acting as a missionary as i said we're the we're centrally located in the west we call it the crossroads of the west you can see what that means in terms of trucking what you can access within 11 hours within 22 hours what you don't see so clearly here but it's it's in the orange lines is we're also at the crossroads in terms of 2 major highways i eighty which goes east to west from new jersey out to san francisco and i 15 which goes from canada down to mexico they both intersect within 5 miles of where i'm sitting same thing's true with the railroads this is where historically the golden spike was laid connecting the east with the west railroads back in the 18 seventies sixties whenever that was the golden spike was in you within an hour of where i'm sitting and we still are at the crossroads of 2 major 2 major railroads northampton burlington northern burlington goes north south from canada to mexico and then the union pacific goes east west again like the highway from san francisco out to the east coast and they all intercept right here in utah so excellent kind of oh and then finally we have an airport brand new the newest international airport in the us it's a delta hub it's again 5 6 miles from downtown fantastic new airport $4,000,000,000 development and it's one of delta's favorite maybe its favorite hub by all accounts and good international connectivity as well and growing with tons of new gates and potential for growth for 20 30 years the way they designed the the site so excellent kinda here in utah strength i already mentioned this very strong population growth often fastest growing state in the country from a population perspective certainly in the top quintile and the same thing with the gdp strong growth it varies from depending on the time period that you're looking at but consistently among the fastest growing states economically as well from a gdp perspective cost of living in utah is reasonable it's not the cheapest state in the country or the cheapest city but it's far from the most expensive i as i said was an executive at goldman sachs i brought goldman sachs to utah utah is now the 2nd largest site for goldman sachs in fact that's the goldman sachs building there in the middle of that picture it's the 2nd largest site for goldman sachs in the us 4th in the world and we studied salt lake city multiple times and the best framing of salt lake in terms of our thinking at was that it was the site where we got the best bang for the buck again wasn't the cheapest but very high quality workforce at a reasonable price so kinda growth at a reasonable price best bang for the buck that's how to think about the cost structure in utah we're also leaders in innovation i mean a few things i mean consistently ranked among the best you can see here for example the milken institute ranked us in the top tier number 6 in the state for technology and science kind of at that core of that is the university of utah again not the not the biggest research institution in the us but ranks 51st with 600,000,000 in federal funding for research you know put that in context i i think university of michigan or johns hopkins leads that and they're over a 1,000,000,000 like 1,400,000,000 so you know bigger but same order of magnitude but where we really shine is in terms of commercialization you can see here we were ranked 1st in technology venture by the milken institute in 17 82% of our startups from the university of utah survived 10 years versus our national average of 55% so high quality startups we also have a high ratio of start ups to invention disclosures a bit of a inside baseball type analysis but 6% of the startups in utah i'm sorry 6% of the inventions disclosed turn into startups and that's twice the national average so you know lots of kind of indicators of of the innovation potential here in utah very consistent with our culture and our our state motto of of of industry we also have strong source of capital this is a point of pride for leaders in the state this was not the case 20 years ago but there's been steady growth in our venture capital community over 800 or 870 startups raised venture capital between 2015 and 2020 they raised $7,000,000,000 we were ranked 14th in the us in terms of venture activity overall for a small state small state by population we had 1,270,000,000 in 2020 but what's really distinctive are these next points the unicorn creation rate per startup so the the rate at which a startup turns into an over $1,000,000,000 company we were first in the us and our growth rate for unicorns is also first in the us and the number of unicorns per capita in the us is 4th in the us so unicorns may be generally hard to find but in utah they're relatively prevalent and and another really strong kind of marker of what makes or why we say utah is such an innovative state terms of venture capital dollars invested as a percent of gdp we're 4th in the us so not big in absolute terms but in terms of relative terms and in terms of quality very very high we are also the most diverse state in terms of our economy in the in the country and diverse here means how well do we match the overall mix of industries in the us some states are more dependent on one industry or another utah is is the most balanced the most diverse in that sense and we have strong target industries across many that i'm sure resonate and and are are significant to the audience today aerospace and defense life sciences financial services already mentioned goldman sachs making it there their 2nd largest home in the us infotech energy advanced manufacturing outdoor products and recreation and tourism and film all significant all is interesting to you in the audience worth exploring with me i hope i just did well home to industry leaders i just flashed a few names here major it employers aerospace financial services and life science companies there are many i hope recognizable names here but it is make no mistake about it an economy based on small business small and medium sized businesses and so it's still an economy where if you're a small or medium sized business and you wanna get some attention some love some access i think you can do it better here than in most states because of our size and because of the importance of small and medium enterprises to the utah economy i just did a small deep dive on aerospace and defense just give a little bit more color i know i know that's an important industry and one we're working with guru on in a in a for a for a specific member of the indian aerospace and defense community we are home to companies like boeing northrop grumman l3 harris parker hannifin hexcel and many others utah is one of 6 defense manufacturing communities in the us named by the department of defense the importance of this industry goes all the way back to the 19 fifties in the creation of composite materials at atk aerospace for the early strategic missile program continues to be anchored by hill air force base a us air force base it's the 2nd largest in the us it's about 40 minutes from city and it's home to the largest squadron of f 30 fives in the world a location where a lot of the maintenance for that fleet is done and where we get a lot of has resolved from countries that have bought s 30 fives and you know just on a on a different kind of dimension to the industry we also are home to space dynamics lab it is a lab at the utah state university maybe an hour and a half 2 hours from here but it is extraordinarily prolific in the production design and well the design really more than the production but the design of man made objects in space small satellite small satellites for the most part and believe it or not the largest source of those items in space in the world is considered to be space dynamics lab they've created so many small satellites that are now in space so some some real hidden gems and again reasons for those in this industry to consider utah as a home fbi though i mean it's it's okay it's good but you can see we kinda lag where we think we should be i mean for all of those strengths we should be at the top and it's it's not like it's a a problem for us but we believe we should be we should be outperforming not slightly underperforming other states and so i keep telling i keep saying to myself in my job that my my my first goal is just to get the word out you can see on the left the percent of jobs that are based on fdi you know utah's in the middle there kinda middling to lower than our neighboring states nevada arizona colorado or or higher i see other ways to look at it not necessarily clear on this page but i think by multiple measures we're we're betting a little below average when we wanna bat above average given all of our strengths with that said we we do have international companies here and i i've listed several from countries all over the world as you can see in terms of incentives we do we do have a a rich set of incentives but the state is relatively conservative economically and most of these incentives are post performance and and we are we believe that there are many reasons to come to utah not just incentives so we we want people we wanna be competitive on incentives but we are not using incentives as the as the kind of key reason for anyone to come to the state we think the the economy the workforce the general culture and many other factors that i've mentioned are the real reasons one should be here for the long term not because of upfront short term incentive and that that's consistent with the with the state's kind of conservative economic principles and and good for you if you come here in the long run because you'd be a member of our community member of our economy and benefit from that i think prudent attitude towards the role of government the role of incentives finally with respect to india this is i think kind of impressive you know i hope it is for you as an audience the the the the numb so the in terms of the percentage of the workforce that was born abroad so so not sorry the the foreign born residents foreign born residents is the word i'm looking for the number one population in in utah is in salt lake city the the major capital city here is mexico which wouldn't surprise you we're probably a 1000 miles from mexico just it's just south of us but the number 2 population or foreign born residents in utah are indians at 4.3% of the population i think some of that is related to the relationship i mentioned earlier between goldman sachs's utah office salt lake office and bangalore there certainly was a significant mic diaspora of indians from from from bangalore to utah as part of the work i did at goldman sachs but but many many other factors as well and we we do have a significant hindu temple here i just listed their mission statement just to give you a feel for that aspect of of indian culture and again if any of you are interested in learning more about utah and and the the how how indians feel here in utah i would be very happy to introduce you to many of my old colleagues who have come here and i i can just say from firsthand experience they have all that i've talked to really enjoyed being here largely because of our our values our family values the quality of education that ml mentioned the quality of life that they can experience here and the the sense of being welcome in in a in in a state here that it that has so much national experience generally and then finally the world trade center i'll just say we we are making utah the crossroads of the world not just the west crossroads of the world one business at a time and we do that in lots of ways these are highlights we've been in business 15 years we won the president's e award export award for export services we we help hundreds of companies we provide hundreds of services we help our main goal is to help promote trade opportunities which we we broadened to include both investment and sales so sales for companies to the world and then investment from the world in utah we add those numbers together and then finally just to the extent anyone here is interested in coming to utah i would say we have 2 main services and we and we help companies all the time in these ways it's just part of our our service is offered supported by by our our our donate our our board members who donate money as well as the state we help with corporate relocation largely these would be existing businesses that are looking for things like market analysis site selection access to incentives local networking we do that in partnership with the economic development corporation of utah partner a sister organization of ours and we're often abroad at trade shows trade missions these kind of events and and if we get interest from from a company we'll talk to them and and you know make sure we understand what their needs are and and often partner then at that point with the economic development corporation of utah we're doing that currently for a a significant company in india and help them look across you know multiple markets to figure out where where they get the best access to the talent where they would get the best access to customers where they could find existing space where they could get you know what the utility rates would be what the you you know for electricity even just not even cost just basic availability of things like water electricity and so forth so that all goes into the market analysis and then and then gets down into site selection we're also making introductions to the state so that they put their best foot forward to get incentives and then help with local networking and getting them to know the players in the community who will be important to them for for their various goals the other thing that we do is help with soft landing these are more startups or small companies that aren't really so concerned about a specific site it might not be eligible up front for incentives they're more interested in things like their first customer where can we get coworking space how can we get access to incubators accelerators partnerships and even venture capitalists or angel investor for capital and we have good networks in all of those you know for all of those purposes and i work with companies all the time to understand what they wanna focus on to understand what their value proposition is and to make introductions and i have you know we have a great relationship great reputation in the community and and a pretty good hit rate of people at least picking up the phone or setting up a meeting to to hear you out you know with respect to to to to your needs so those are those are broadly how we help companies kind of in the situation i think many of you would be in and yeah that i'm gonna i'm gonna leave it at that i'm david karlbach i'm the chief operating officer and md for international programs here at world trade center and that's my contact information i'd love to hear from you after this event or or maybe in the q and a session back to you guru great thank thank you david i hope am audible now yep great thank you thank you all for staying quiet and muting your devices thank you so much i think the video presentation was great but i'll come back to you i i have a i have to step back a little bit because i lost a little bit of my content before your presentation but before i get back to the continuity of the seminar i wanted to welcome air marshal baladitya and also air marshal bapat thank you for joining us and and warm welcome to all the veterans both in india and in the united states also welcoming irkamad or jesse ma excuse me so thanks guru i i wanted to kind of go ahead please thank you very much guru oh you're most welcome and thank you for thank you for your time and thank you for all the service to the nation excuse me so stepping stepping back a little bit i will come back to david's presentation and i want to set the context so we're today discussing collaboration between india and the united states and i was having a conversation with ambassador tigrunar yesterday and you know we discussed a very important point the the point today is is globalization challenged india wants to make everything in india america wants to make everything in america there's nothing wrong in that right because every nation wants to wants to be the superpower in some way or the other so there is this there's this tough act of balancing between globalization and localization and i think that is a challenge for 2023 and and we will we will discuss that going forward in the in the panel discussion and i'll definitely have david weigh in on some of these you know dynamics that are going on in the geopolitical you know context at at the same time what we heard from david about utah gives us a good ground level view of what possibilities exist for collaboration now when we talk of collaboration at a macro level at the government level you know sectoral level we we can talk global statistics which are rendered by cnn and fox news and ndtv all the time i'm trying to get this discussion in the next 60 to 80 minutes to a point where we take away some actionable items where as a think tank we can facilitate some collaboration at some level and and create a path for that and that's really what i'm excited about having people like david and jonathan and you know general krishnan speaking to us today and we will get back to the core of the topic so so in terms of themes we have 2 themes today the high level theme is about collaboration between the two nations and the subtheme is as a think tank how do we play a role in facilitating in bringing both countries together in bringing people together in bringing business and trade together right and we have some examples and and you'll hear a lot going going forward and i'll also take a minute quickly to introduce david he's got a terrific profile i know he's he's done his presentation but but i i i can't resist it of talking about david kalbeck i met him recently in in utah and and he's very inspiring as he said he's the chief operating officer and managing director international programs for world trade center utah he oversees hr finance and operations as well as international programs so he's the go to person for for international programs and david you're in the right forum and we're in the right forum with you as well and he was previously managing director of goldman sachs and he's also got phenomenal experience in asian countries he's played a big role in setting up goldman sachs in asia including bangalore david and and he's also you know handled wealth management change management etcetera and he's he really put goldman sachs on the map in in utah and i'm sure thousands of people are thanking him for the employment that they got because you took the leadership and thank you for that and he was also a management consultant in his earlier life worked with booz allen and hamilton in in dallas dusseldorf munich i'm i'm not sure if i'm pronouncing it right and new york he's also been an entrepreneur he's an honors graduate from chicago booth school of business and the university of michigan and he is fluent in english and german has 3 children and is happily helping companies move globally and to utah's in utah so that's about david right so so david we'll we'll come back to you in the panel discussion on on on some specifics and thank you for your coverage of getting us about utah a lesser known state so from a collaboration perspective whether it's an asian country or a european country or or a south american country wanting to move to us there there are 3 geographies that everyone mute please thank you so the 3 geographies that you know come to everybody's mind let me let me but why would this be open can everybody yeah another request please stay muted we're having some technical issue i'm not able to mute everyone everyone stay muted please thank you so so when when we think of movement from outside to us the 3 geographies that are you know resonating always new york new jersey washington dc texas and california right now utah is a lesser known state from an overseas perspective and i think i think the essence of what you brought david here is is gonna be quite quite valuable and and so let's let's pause the move on to the next segment i have the pleasure of welcoming lieutenant general ca krishnan and i'll just introduce left hand general krishnan he was a deputy chief of army staff several medals celebrated military leader in india pvsm usm absm top

for organizing it thank you very much i must say it's where a big privilege indeed a great privilege to share this platform with the other distinguished panelists david and jonathan it's so wonderful to be co panelists to have you both as the co panelist now ladies and gentlemen going straight into the topic let me very briefly recall some very salient aspects that provide us a backdrop to the whole gamut of india us collaboration we are talking about collaboration between 2 countries the largest and the most powerful democracy in the world population wise number 1 and number 3 countries in the world i'm assuming that you know as we are speaking india has actually caught up with china in the population numbers if you take in terms of gdp while us ranks number 1 india ranks number 5 and it is said to be number 1 and number 3 by 2030 and let's say in terms of the military strength us everyone knows is the number one most powerful country in the world and india is number 4 and something besides this the indian diaspora of 2,700,000 is the highest earning ethnic group in the us but despite all this the us india bilateral relations are far from that of 2 natural partners and it witnesses considerable fluctuations caused by the winds of geopolitics as everybody's aware the tussle for global power play is hotting up us continues to be the leader but china is steadily closing in we are witnessing adjustments and realignments in geopolitics especially lately caused by the war in ukraine the pandemic and an increasingly assertive china we're witnessing the biggest churn in geopolitics and supply chains and a hugely turbulent global economy coming to india within the region india has stakes in central and west asia apart from south asia of course india also has a significant role to play in the indo pacific region in addition to enhanced economic and tech cooperation india is increasingly being seen as a net security provide in the region i know and the examples of this are quad the u two i two and the ipef platforms they are all clear indicators of this fact that i've just mentioned the geopolitical turbulence and the turbulence caused by an assertive china in particular is creating conditions which are conducive for closer us india relations in 21 22 us was india's biggest trading partner with a bilateral merchandise trade of about $119,000,000,000 but we are it was closely followed by the chinese chinese trade which was totaled about $115,000,000,000 now india's trade with china this year has increased to about $135,000,000,000 but with a disturbing fact india is running a negative trade balance of over a $100,000,000,000 in its trade with china the service sector trade actually is india's service sector exports is about 100 and it's about $270,000,000,000 and that is a bright spot as far as india is concerned you know the service sector trade surplus india run surplus in service sector of about $112,000,000,000 that is what helps india actually bill out out of the $250,000,000,000 negative merchandise trade balance to a large extent incidentally by 2030 the indo us bilateral trade is expected to touch about 500 to $600,000,000,000 now india's economic growth aspirations and our journey towards a $5,000,000,000,000 and beyond economy assumes a steady growth in all sectors of economy and aerospace and defense industries will form a very important part of this out of the numerous areas actually which offers scope for enhanced collaboration between india and us two areas that i would touch upon very briefly are the aerospace and defense sector and the green energy sector coming to the first part you know the chinese have been very aggressive and unpredictable along india's northern borders lately in the past few about 3 to 4 years but in many ways they have done india a favor by this action in my opinion it has actually brought in a much needed clarity in terms of the chinese inclination towards resolution of the dispute that we have with them and it has also opened our eyes and the eyes of the world to the actual extent of the china dimension in their security challenges so under these circumstances an appreciable increase in the budgetary allotment for modernization of india's armed forces in the coming decade is a given and in the backdrop of india's atmanirbir approach this would translate into scope for a many fold increase in the breadth and depth of collaboration between india's domestic private sector and the global aerospace and defense place so collaboration would be in terms of technological and financial support defense production by 2025 is $25,000,000,000 which includes an export target of about $5,000,000,000 for the period 2020 2025 now india's defense budget for this current year 22 23 india's financial year as most of you would know starts from the 1st april till 31st march of the following year so for the year 22 23 our defense budget is about $70,600,000,000 of this about 1 fourth or 24% to be precise is earmarked as modernization budget for procurement of you know war equipment now about 1 third of the modernization budget which works out about between 5 to $6,000,000,000 is earmarked for indigenous acquisition for the indigenous players and even within that 25% of that acquisition budget is earmarked purely for the private players in the in india which works out to about 1 and a half $2,000,000,000 now these figures will only go up considerably in the years ahead india needs to be very in our aspiration for giving a boost to our domestic defense industry we we have to be very real realistic in our approach particularly towards selection of partners and the rule the route to follow in this context when we look around there is something that i would like to highlight the top 5 global defense industries are all us entities in the top 10 global aerospace and defense industries 6 of them are the us entities 3 are chinese and 1 there is 1 uk company and if you take the top 100 global aerospace and defense entities 46 of them are american companies so from every perspective the aerospace and defense sector provides a huge scope for indo us collaboration india and us must make full use of the prevailing conducive environment for collaboration and make it a win win proposition it's actually a ready made environment for fostering collaboration between the two countries particularly in the aerospace and defense sector india on its part needs to enhance its value as a partner in terms of appropriately skilling human resource manufacturing and services infrastructure enabling policies efficient institutions reliability etcetera us on its part while appreciating the immense scope for a strong us india partnership must also needs to bear in mind some of the political and legal impediments in assisted democracy like india and for the us i must also say that india is not just another buyer of military hardware it's a partnership which has the potential with huge long term benefits for both sides not only in the aerospace and defense sector in any sector that we may take so having said that i must point out that a lot of spade work has been done to facilitate or in other words to lay the foundation for a close indo us cooperation collaboration in the a and d sector these include you know the agreement such as the first one i would bring out is a basic exchange and cooperation agreement for geospatial intelligence which is called baker and then we have the logistics exchange memorandum agreement which is commonly known in the a and b circles as the limo and the communication compatibility and security arrange agreement which is comcasa now together what these agreements have done is they have provided a very firm foundation for a strong long term indo us collaboration particularly in aerospace and defense now going further i must highlight here especially for the benefit of the those who have joined us from the us indian government has made considerable progress in opening up defense industries to domestic private sector and to facilitate fdi into the sector and the examples are new procurement categories for aerospace and defense such as by indian the indigenous design development and manufacturing category by global but manufacturing india category strategic partnership model that's another category and also we have a newly introduced category which is which permits leasing of equipment now india also has idex which is innovation for defense excellence as a platform for startups to facilitate startups a 70% self reliance target in weaponry by 2027 introduction of green channel status policy which permits a great deal of self certification also relaxation of licensing norms a lot of you may be interested this actually provides the fdi for new licensees up to 75% through the automatic route and in excess of 70 purse 4% under the government route there is provision for existing licenses also for fdi infusion up to 49% there is a list of items summed under import ban and the mod has indicated that during the next 5 to 7 years potential orders worth almost $57,000,000,000 is likely to be available for the domestic a and d industry now in addition we also have introduction of policy on exchange rate variation positive indigenization list separate head for domestic procurement and setting up of defense corridors the wish list naturally includes a lot more the first and the foremost thing is word that every defense private sector player in india says that you facilitate production by placing orders that has been something which is one thing but then maybe we could discuss at the end there there there is certainly a way out and placing orders cannot be the start point for an industry to start especially for a startup funding of r and d there is a great deal that needs to be done within india encourage and facilitate domestic place to acquire establish aerospace and defense com elsewhere in the world and also there is there is scope for extending what is called the pli scheme there's a prediction linked incentive schemes that the government has given to certain sectors there is scope for extending this into the defense industry as well as more also and i expect this to come soon let me also list out some specific segments which offer great opportunities for collaboration in the a and d sector the list is indeed very very long but i'm only mentioning just a handful here the first thing that comes to my mind is the scope for establishing mro facilities in india to serve global clients india has everything in it to become huge mro hub for the world especially for aircraft ships and major systems the other things which come to my mind are you know simulators immense scope for simulators especially for a huge army like india which operates from deserts to the glaciers to the high altitude mountains and covering such a huge coastline nexus of 7,500 kilometers the score for simulators is really immense so is the case with the ammunition considering the huge quantity of emission that is stopped and the imperative need for turnover implies that there is a constant need for supply of a huge inventory of ammunition other things are altering vehicles exoskeletons innovative smart solutions for fighting in the mountains artificial intelligence applications cyber robotics uav surveillance devices like i said i just listed out a handful only of the huge list now at this point i must say a word about quad in this context in the critical rare earth segment quad has the potential within its members to establish the entire rare earth supply chain because quad has countries which have the upstream raw material it has countries with midstream com mid midstream compounds and components and manufacturing capability and also within its fold it has countries with the know how to manufacture high end downstream products it's actually a tailor made grouping which can create an alternative to the chinese data supply chain and break the monopoly that they enjoy as of today now before i close let me move away from the aerospace and defense sector and very briefly highlight a point regarding the scope for collaboration the huge collaboration scope in green energy and green technology particularly from an indian perspective now india's per capita energy consumption is just about 1 third the global average at less than 7,000 kilowatt hour you know it's 1 third the global average i'm talking about now because of this very low energy consumption our per capita carbon emission is also one of the lowest at 1.6 tons it is just about 1 fourth the global average per capita emission now what does this indicate is if you go beyond and see despite this abysmally slow per capita energy consumption and carbon emission because of the huge population india's gross carbon emission is the 3rd highest in the world behind just the us and china now we need to view this in the context of the fact that india has just about embarked upon an ambitious economic growth trajectory and we have a very long way to climb and this will be one of our biggest dilemmas as we go forward india's huge developmental aspirations will have to be bent with very low carbon footprint going green is more critical and essential for india than any than it is for any other country ladies and gentlemen therefore i will close by saying that apart solar wind waste energy route waste to energy route green hydrogen recycling industry etcetera along with the aerospace and defense industries will probably be the biggest bundle of opportunities that will unfold as india moves forward with that i'll close if there is anything more we can take it during the question and answer session thank you ladies and gentlemen thank you general krishnan very very insightful the focus on aerospace and defense was so so well orchestrated and we couldn't really get a better perspective than what you gave both from us and india perspectives and india's vision to get to a bilateral trade of 500 to 600,000,000,000 looks like it's realizable considering us is the largest trading partner for for india and i know there is a lot happening in the aerospace and different space aerospace and different space already between india and us and on the flip side there's also significant investments from india into the us in terms of industry and even you know education and so on and so forth so general question we'll come back to you during the discussion and thanks for your insight a great presentation there it's time for me to introduce jonathan bench again a board world trade center board member he's the chair of harris bricken's corporate practice group and he's an attorney but he helps entrepreneurs companies and venture capital and private equity firms with international and domestic business transactions so he's he's literally at a vantage point to facilitate collaboration asian countries moving to us and vice versa and so on he's an emerging legal expert in the fast moving and complex web 3 ecosystem including business and regulatory issues surrounding decentralized autonomous organizations contracts decentralized finance cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens nfts and that's that's very impressive david you know you're you're really in the realm of emerging technologies combining finance and legal domains together that's awesome and this is the most interesting part about jonathan from selling homegrown raspberries to window washing services to nonemergency medical transportation services jonathan understands entrepreneurial work from inside in his spare time he's often with his wife mary anne and their 5 lively children exploring the beautiful youth outdoors practicing martial arts so be careful with him he can knock us out learning guitar that's the musical element of jonathan and he's now working on getting his spanish to be as good as his chinese jonathan welcome over to you thank you guru it's great to be here with general krishnan david and and all of you respected guests it's it's wonderful i have to tell you a little anecdote while i'm getting my my screen share up when i i grew up in the midwest in wisconsin and central midwest and one of my one of my best friends growing up is a his name was arjun pratavathi pratavathi arjun and he his family moved to the us when i think when he right before he was born so absolutely wonderful to have an opportunity to to share this and i have a lot of good friends that i've developed over the years as well and so i think on my when mary asked me for a quote i said from where i've sat and i've i've done business with in and with china and chinese people for over 20 years now and my understanding of what i'm reading in the world and seeing in the world is that the us india partnership is is the most important relationship for the next decade and that's me speaking personally that's me speaking professionally i have family members who were in the us military and i see everything that's i second everything that's been said today about opportunities and also understanding where each country is coming from and and our responsibilities to collaborate to to spread democracy and to really make you know make the world a better safer more fair place for for everyone so let me see if i can it's always i'm screen sharing let me see if i can get full screen because it's always the there we go it's always the challenge to get this up on my full screen it's my one limitation here let me see if that goes where i want it to there we go okay so i'll give you a little bit of a road map and i've gotta hide this now so i can see everything sorry everyone let me move so i can move this around hide the video panel there we go okay so in my in my experience i spend a lot of time helping us companies go abroad and i help a lot of international companies come to the us so in this vantage point i have you know dozens of conversations a year with companies that are exploring the greater geopolitical environment greater business environment and from my vantage point here in the us which is a desirable country for investment and for opportunities for people to to come and be here and live here i have a very interesting perspective and and i forget sometimes that not everyone has this perspective so i wanted to share with you a little bit how to understand the us as a market itself understand investment in the us and what that looks like so this is very us centric i'm not gonna i'm happy to speak on on china matters if anyone has questions about what's going on in china or how that's gonna impact global global relations but this is a us focused presentation so i will keep it keep it on the us side so moving forward a lot of people will look at the us map and try to understand and it is very mystifying to some extent that the us has 50 different states every state has its own smaller legal system with a federal overlay although i know that is common in india as well so not not as unfamiliar to you when i when i have questions from individuals about where do we go in the us or should we set up as a delaware company or i've heard wyoming is a good alternative or nevada or should i go in any of these should i focus on kind of friendly state regulations delaware wyoming nevada or should i look at utah or should i look at population centers right we have new york and illinois and florida and texas and california where we have you know a large diaspora we have large market sizes we have employees we're close to the coastal shipping ports and i think david's done a great job of explaining why utah has done a good job of leveraging its its outdoor resources its work ethic and and certainly its proximity to the coast and and understanding of what makes what makes utah special we are a small state but i think that our our work ethic and our our willingness and kind of our our ethos of engaging with the world is it runs very deep that's why i've spent 20 years learning chinese that's why my children are in chinese immersion school that's why i'm learning spanish as well because we feel a responsibility and and an obligation and and really for me it's a it's an interest in making sure that i understand as best i can what makes other nations special what makes the what's the history of the of the country of the people what the desires are and it makes me a better business lawyer to understand those motivating factors in my clients and in the nations where they want to do business going on i'm always there we go just in case you're curious i i put this together for a prior presentation it's always fun for me to look at and understand the most populous states in the us and the languages that are spoken and as i won't go through this in-depth but you'll see some of the indian dialects in all of these most populous nations and as david mentioned we have a good number of people of indian descent in utah as well so the big questions about entering the u s is how do we come to the u s and you have options you can come directly without forming an entity in the us you can come as a c corporation you can come as an llc have different tax ramifications different as you see here limited liability we only have we only have limited liability in the us if you actually set up an entity but for some indian indian companies and i have worked with several indian companies coming to the states sometimes it's more of a want to test the waters and so we'll just come in directly the us is extremely easy and fast to set up entities so if you have a you know if you wanna test the waters you have a question about whether the market really will respond to your product or service there's no minimum capital investment in any state in any no matter how you enter in there are no restrictions on foreign ownership with the exception of maybe some defense related categories their income tax is certainly applicable but everyone has to deal with that you have to get a tax id number and india of course has a tax treaty with the us and so that's a nice a nice feather in the cap when we're looking at kind of general business incentives david mentioned that utah does not utah is not participating a familiar concept to you utah does not want to give does not want to be a wyoming and i say that a little bit pejoratively but wyoming is our neighboring state and it's income tax free but wyoming has the reasons why wyoming or nevada which are basically desert states need to provide those kind of incentives whereas utah feels like we have a great round pool of assets and so we don't need to participate in the race to the bottom so we have a great we have great programs but we also have we also have a lot of other assets so these are some of the incentives that you'll see as you're looking at different us states and as you're engaging with different us government us government state government entities there'll be a focus on key industries high-tech is it's always important there may be certain investment thresholds especially when we're looking at rural areas so i'll talk about that in a few minutes when we're looking at immigration incentives for individuals and companies to invest in the us we always have to deal with income taxes and duties you may be able to negotiate some rent some rent subsidies and there are always tax benefits as well and those tend to be the tax benefits tend to be across the board for at a federal level and some at the state level as well i wanna give you a little bit of an overlay on investment in the us because a lot of a lot of companies wants to know how do we come to the us what is the right way to come to the us and so whether you're raising capital in the us which i think a lot of companies wanted to do they want to come to the states they want to grow the business and and perhaps eventually take the company public in this kind of on a us exchange or multiple exchanges us and other nations as well and so we have 2 major when i have companies that come to me and say we want to come to the us and we think we're going to be raising capital in the next year or 2 i always have to make sure they understand that raising capital in the us is a very serious thing even if you have friends and family it is a very serious matter that the sec the securities and exchange commission has jurisdiction over and every state as well has its own securities commission so anytime and i know this is common in all nations but it's especially important in the us that when companies are raising capital that it's done the right way that it's done with the right disclosures and that is the way to keep all of the promoters and all of the executives out of jail it's it's just a very serious thing in the us as you know so there are 2 different ways to think about investment raising capital whether you are thinking about taking your company public eventually or whether you are raising private capital and it it is a it is a bit of a the reason i chose this chessboard image is because whenever a company comes to me and says they want to raise capital i need to understand who they plan on raising from who they've been in conversations with what kinds of promises they've made and so whether that whether those individuals are in the us where the money will come from or outside the us there are obligations when we're talking about using a us entity to raise the capital from so just a flag for that it's it's not something i take lightly it's not something that my clients take lightly either and and the government certainly doesn't either the us you may have heard this acronym it's called cfius c f i u s the committee on foreign investment in the us this committee is not new but it was reenergized in around 2018 under president trump's administration when when the us started to get more cautious about interactions with china so the committee on foreign investment in the us basically looks at every has the opportunity to look at every investment certain industries and there are only few safe harbor safe harbor countries so the types of investments that matter to committee on foreign investment in the us and let me back up i won't i won't i don't wanna dive in too deep yet but i'll i'm trying to move quickly because i know we're we're all we're all a rush for time so in the us every investment from outside the us into the us needs to go through this type of analysis any business that's that's going to be doing any investment in the us unless it's a greenfield's investment and even the greenfields investment you have to look at the real estate location but for all other investments in the us whether it's a minority investment this could be a passive or active investment it could be an acquisition could be a partial acquisition full acquisition venture capital private equity any of those transactions even if it's a a minority stake and even if it's a a very passive investment the attorney the law firm and the company needs to do an analysis and i did this already i think a year and a half ago with an indian company an it company in india quite a large public indian it company that was acquiring a us company a private us company and so we had to go through this cfius analysis and eventually ended up doing a cfius submission and so this process is really deciding is this the type of investment that the committee is gonna be interested in and is this the type of investment that we need to disclose so it doesn't mean you have to disclose every transaction every kind of investment that comes from india to the us or any kind of business venture from india to the us but it means you need to look at at what's going on and decide whether or not you need to disclose and it basically pushes the the timeline of the transaction back 1 to 2 to 3 months it depends on on how how interested the committee is so we're looking at controlling interests particularly important even non controlling interests if there are other rights tied to it like making board decisions the types of industries so this is not all this is not all industries this is not all all companies so we're looking at critical we call it tid so critical technology critical infrastructure sensitive personal data and i give it examples here that i won't go over but if any of your transactions are going to involve important technology or us infrastructure or personal data on us citizens those all need to be potentially reviewed as i said there are only a few safe harbor countries this is the 4th bullet down only canada uk australia new zealand are currently safe harbor countries india is not yet that may be part of our ongoing collaboration where india can be blanket whitelisted for investments and i would think that based on our on our proximity in terms of democracies and our alignments in the pacific that that could be a possibility coming in in the next few years so that would make it easier we have the potential for outbound us investment restrictions coming probably in 2023 and this has been in the news in the us where it won't just be investments outside the us to the us it's going to be us companies scrutinized for where they're investing this happened with the passage of the consolidation consolidated corporations act of 2023 which would pass last month and it basically the president basically mandated the department of treasury and commerce to determine what it would cost to establish an outbound investment screening program and us congress has been working on that as well and this is mostly focused on national securities of course we're we're all talking about china without necessarily mentioning china at every instance but this is mainly focused on china and certainly in india you understand the ramifications for china flexing its might and growing even though china has its more than its share internal struggles as well for the last few minutes i wanna talk about investments because when as we know there's a a large indian diaspora there are a lot of individuals who want to know how do i invest in the us what if i come to live in the us for a while could i bring my family and and other things so there are a lot of us visas available i can't go over them in-depth but i have colleagues who who are experts in this space who can talk about the specific categories of visas the timing all the requirements i can tell you that every year in march is the deadline for this so any right now is our busy season at the firm for for clients who are asking these questions about how do we come to the us how do we invest the money what's the right way if we wanna get a certain kind of residency visa or green card and these hinge on whether companies are gonna be making active investments or passive investments typically the active invest means that you'll be setting up a us subsidiary and you'll be sending executives from india to the us less complex for qualifications and the eb5 is the most common more more complex criteria but there's a recent reform and integrity act that i'm gonna talk about on the next slide so i'm gonna use my friend josh this isn't made up not not a made up name of course but a made up profile as a 37 year old indian citizen in mumbai with 2 children wife is also well trained he has grad undergraduate and graduate degrees in in computer science and worked for other companies and then started his own company 5 years ago so someone like jayesh would be a good profile to consider if i want to come to the us or i want to invest in the us what is the right way to do it because he will have multiple options the first is the l one a and this is this is where we'd be setting up a us subsidiary sending some managers and it could be himself if he is the owner and also a manager sending himself and his family to the us to establish business relationships it is a a nice visa because it is a clear criteria and it allows dual intent meaning that it can be converted from a a working visa into a a green card eventually it includes the spouses and children can be can be in the country as well the other one is the eb5 eb5 is the more passive investor program the amount of investment used to be 500,000 it was just up to $800,000 new commercial enterprise and it's especially focused on development in what we call the new commercial new commercial enterprises in rural areas are very important as you know in india the us is gonna be focused on building infrastructure gonna pop these out here okay so infrastructure development rural areas and unemployment these are 3 big targets and of course i have to imagine that india has similar programs to help rural areas get developed to help areas where there is high unemployment and to build critical infrastructure for transportation and communications so in the guru asked me when we were talking about this whether there was any new things that came out especially regarding this investor program and this the eb5 reform and integrity act that was reformed about 9 months ago this set aside an aggregate of 32% of the us visas in this space for rural areas unemployment high employment areas and infrastructure projects so this is this is how people can skip the line and get ahead of those who have already applied for the eb five visa who have not gone into these priority areas so this this reform means that you'll have a quicker decision making process and it allows concurrent filings so people can be on dual tracks or triple tracks for trying to get a us green card so certainly i'm an advocate for people living where they want to live and working where they want to live and i know that india is a beautiful wonderful country but there are people who are interested in coming to the states as well and and the us is always gonna be focused on smart immigration policies that bring entice the the best and brightest to who want to come to the us so there are certainly avenues for doing that and and the us will continue to remain focused on that my last consideration is a little bit on employment when i when i talk to companies that are coming to the us about the us i like to help them think about the us in terms of finding a state that is either pro labor or pro employer and it's it's not it's not a perfect analogy but most of the coastal states us especially the east and the west are pro labor states and most of the middle states and the southern states are pro employer states and of course as employers you're always interested in taking care of your people but individuals want to and and executives and owners want to make sure that they have ultimate control maximum control of the business so certainly written employment contracts are are issues that come up collective labor is also a rising issue in the united states and i know you're familiar with that in india as well and then just understanding the criteria for when employees can be terminated what those consequences are there's there's currently a lot of discussion in the us right now about non competes and whether or not employers can or should be able to require employees to sign non competes that does not affect employers' information so let's say employers' confidential information any trade secrets that are that are owned by the business but this just means that they would be less able to restrict employees from moving around at will and working for competitors as long as they don't take any trade secrets with them so that was a a fast rundown on the us it's a dynamic economy i see a lot of very interesting people i i love my job because i get to work with so many international companies smart people who are engaging with the world and and certainly i'm happy to have been able to spend some time with all of you today i look forward to the the

        "name": "Presentation on MMCM-Automotive Circulatory Orchestrator \uff5c Nitin Chitkara\u29f8Launch Event DigiELV & ELV",
        "content": "i invite the ceo of mmcm meta materials circular markets private limited the company that we have formed to talk more about it another nitin my colleague nitin chitkara thank you bragang and good afternoon everyone so nothing can be better when the policymaker himself shrinitin ghatkarriji is here to inaugurate dglv dglv is actually a catalyst for this particular end of life vehicle policy which has been thoughtfully created by ministry of road transport if you are aware that there are certain discounts offered for the sustainable efforts job lock up my end of life vehicle the market may scrap rvs of course specifically but in india we see that there are multiple people who can't afford new vehicles but they have old vehicle to scrap so this benefit so ecosystem we have called dgelv customers go or monetary value realize i would immediately ask to start a 2 minute video on dglv scrapping your end of life vehicle through an environment friendly registered vehicle scrapping facility is definitely a sustainable action the vehicle scrapping policy 2021 by the government of india facilitates a certificate of deposit to be issued to the owners of end of life vehicles who choose to scrap their vehicles for selecting environment friendly rbsfs the policy mentions that the certificate alternatively the certificate can be traded against monetary value by passing the benefits to another user digilv integrated with wahaan is the platform enabling such trade transactions when a user does not want to buy a new vehicle and wants to monetize the benefits against their sustainable action digi elv system provides an easy to use interface to the system instantly generates a transfer certificate of deposit that can be immediately used by the new user the amount for the certificate is credited to the account of the certificate seller during its initial beta phase over 800 people have availed the benefits of digield platform at digield believe that every sustainable action is recognized and rewarded thank you for the video we at mmcm believe that any action towards automobile circularity is surely a sustainable action and the ecosystem partners who are involved in this journey beat rbs beat oems beat other service provider are definitely doing a sustainable effort so we at mmcm want to take a role of orchestrator for the circular economy where a ecosystem can be created by creating a data sharing structure in place for all the for all the ecosystem partners so we we know that as of now 40 plus rbsfs are operational and around 40 plus in pipeline which would be and there is a long list waiting for the approval of rbsf but the current fact is the number of vehicles which are reaching to this rbsf are very very low not only that rbsf are also struggling what to do with reusable material reusable components they are not aware they are also not aware whether a component can be sold in open market or not or if it can be sold whether it is fit to be sold or not so these are certain challenges rvsava are currently facing in addition to that we also know that automobile epr which is about to come and automobile company need to prepare for that so with all these things because we have that there is a need of a common interface or a common ecosystem where the data and the information can be exchanged between each other rbsfr definitely generating material but that material can be used for fulfillment of eprs or not rbsfr are also generating tire e waste battery waste used oil and epr is actually applicable in all so can there be a closed ecosystem which connects to all industry players and give them an option to interact with each other that is the thought process behind coming up as a auto circularity orchestrator so what role we are assuming 1st and foremost our nation or our industry without set standards is not possible so the first and foremost thing is we need to formally set certain standards on the definite definitely on the component front what all components can be used and what all components cannot be used there would be a standard and then can they be refurbished and can be further reused so standards are definitely required not only that there are multiple other standards required whether all the rbsf are working in a proper way because we have seen that every rbs has different style of working some are really really wonderful some still lack to a certain extent so that whether that can be managed that can be further refined so all those standards are required so first and foremost we will be working on the standards for the automotive circularity 2nd is approach of catalyst so there are multiple partners starting from bfsi because when a vehicle gets sold loans are generally there even for the service we have seen that people are connecting to financial institutions insurance is also a very important part so these would by default become ecosystem partners they are centers there are 1,000 of lakhs of service centers across india if they can be connected to rbsf because they know which vehicle is going to be end of life in what time so what happened in the initial 1st 5 years a vehicle is connected to auto ems because regular service or thrice service centers are generally touched post that it's actually to the open market and all these unorganized service center or we call multi multi oem service centers are actually the key information key information people who know which which would get retired so we want to create a ecosystem where the information is available and they can also get benefit out of that so we can connect those service centers to the ecosystem and then the information can be seamlessly passed availability of tech platforms and tech ecosystem partners so this is another challenge we know that there are multiple secondhand vehicle sales portal currently in india but none very limited portals for connecting end of life vehicles because the margin margin is really less so we we believe that there should be certain portals who can come up on the board and especially working around end of life vehicle sourcing 4th and last and for for 4th one is that due to this sustainable activity which are through the waste management of end of life vehicle can there be carbon reduction managed can can there be a traceability of the carbon what they are saving for the environment so we have worked out with iit mumbai and a couple of international institutions and we find that yes there could be carbon savings calculated through end of life vehicle waste management so we are also enabling openly a 40 point digital mrv solution which can be used by all the rbsfs so as i mentioned who are the stakeholders there is a long list as stakeholders for the entire ecosystem starting from vehicle owners and scrappers service centers part refurbishers metal manufacturers oems etcetera and a seamless information flow is required to each and everyone so this is the role what we want to achieve through auto so what circularity orchestration means for oems and rbsf we know that there is a big big requirement coming to the oems so one definitely is decentralized collection centers as i mentioned that we are now trying to have an ecosystem where all these service centers can be linked to the rbss directly and vehicle can be sourced so decentralized currently what is happening that rbsf is actually concentric to his own zone and connected to 4 5 collection points but we want a ecosystem where the decentralized information can be passed to the all the rvfs 2nd is for oem specific hybrid oem ecosystem for the for the epr purpose because epi liability is coming and then opening rvsf by oems may not make sense so can can it can this happen that in the rbsf i can have a separate wafer specific this is the thought process we definitely need to work with the oems on that but a specific facility for specific oems can be made available can be connected and then joint public awareness is also required so we believe that a joint effort by oems rbsf and ecosystem partners towards the sustainability and sustainable way of recycling is very important and we want to enable that through the acr another is seamless supply chains reasonable component tracking so every rbsf is now generating components but that information is not available outside of the rbsf so the ecosystem should be there where the material availability is passed to the material user and and the entire information what we're talking about because see oem would definitely want their information should not be passed to other oems or somewhere else similarly similarly your scrappers would also want that their specific information or their competitive information should not go so the ecosystem what we are thinking to create would work on 0 knowledge proof information so that the data without any collateral information would pass on so person would know a scrap part is available and it would reach to him but where it is lying all that information may not be relevant so that is there and as i mentioned the policy and the standardization development is really really important it's a standard for component reusability sustainable practice in the rbsf and certification for the rbsf is also required what we believe should be part of this orchestration so what is the immediate proposition as seo i mentioned that we have now partners which have their collection centers or they have actually the service centers available across india so that are easily available or immediately available for rbsf now to use similarly those all service centers can be a can be a source for selling your auto components rbsf management system is another piece which i believe is required by all the rbsfs few rbsf who can invest more as capital in the systems they have created 1 but if somebody's required this rbsf management system that is actually available now and that can be used by the rbsf and your compliance reports can all directly be generated to the the the system itself i only mentioned about cod avoidance dmrv it is actually now a open system any rbsf can join and see whether they they are used they are scrapping their vehicle as per the the dmre requirement for carbon credit generation or not and last but not the least is epr traceability so for epr we definitely have from the source of vehicle till the time it is dismantled entire thing would be available through the systems in addition to that for the oems further traceability from the material when it is going out from the rvsf till the point it is reaching to the steel mills and then coming back to the oem equipment manufacturer complete traceability can be enabled so the idea is that we want to create this entire ecosystem but without industry support without oem support without rbsf support this cannot be created so we definitely need your inputs your support in creating such ecosystem which is actually useful for the entire circular industry or automobile circular industry and we need your support on that at last we can only do it together it cannot be done by a lone mmcm or so thank you so much",

        "name": "Special Address by Shri Ved Prakash Mishra \uff5c Conference on Role of EPR on Circular Economy",
        "content": "right our very very special guest in fact the chief guest of this session shrivate pratak mishasar i think now i don't have much to say but i think you might have been all of you have been actively engaged in the implementation of the policies frame by us and we have we are very happy that after a initial recap after initial initiation the industry the recyclers the producers all are very happy and very enthusiastically supporting the endeavor of government to reach up to optimal waste management and recycling see this this ter recycling or the social efficiency or the proper waste management cannot be done by government alone unless we have support of the industry the public the regulatory regulators the ngos and all the stakeholders and mind you that we all are stakeholder every person maybe the industrialist maybe the state vendor maybe the common man all our stakeholders in this in this endeavor because it affects everyone of us we have we have floated the the e west e blast 5 sectors i think in white below e west battery plastic and and we will also be coming in some other sectors like scrap metals and construction in even even in cod waste construction device service even there even there we are trying to introduce epra policy because people just this demand is their own home's own success they leave it like that so we we think that that can also be neutralized again that is highly utilized again that that that will we see that of course but not to the extent which we want so to api responsibility is very important tool in in in probability because in that we say that the the liability or responsibility of producers is much more than just just by fetching and selling the products and taking profit from that so but if we are not the only way we will also try to create the idea like the theme of this closed conference that the after what after what after is cycling if after recycling you make some srm secondary raw materials that we call urban mining that that is also mining without destroying our earth so what is the scope for that market what is the scope of that debt the profit from debt recycling or demand for that we are also the the the industry and the the manufacturers and the designers they have to create their demand they they have to make it such a lucrative business such a i quite this should be such a high level that it should create its own demand however government will also support in creating the demand in some sectors we may mandate the use of secondary raw materials but not not right now because it may create a lot of issue but in future we may think over it if it we see that the recyclers are not getting handled or the recyclers are not getting that must support for us the recyclers are our friends recyclers are friends of environment they are friends of government because they are doing the work which is beneficial for the society it may i feel the profit they are only byproduct they are actually cleaning our cleaning our earth cleaning our society and as madam said when karam said that there's not much talk about the us logistics that is a really difficult thing us logistics how to get back the the things and and in that the institutions like our led by you are are doing a great work and we recognize that and in our in our rooms also we have recognized that that we are doing great work but the as per the government policy we want to have minimum regulation so so we are not regulating the institutions or our relations which are helping reverse logistics but we appreciate their work if any problem is there we can we are always there to help and and they they they are very much they have our test support we we explicitly we have not taken much but but we have the very much appreciate their efforts and i will now i will request the all the the industry and the and the policy the other influences that they should extend their wholehearted support in this effort of the government and the ministry and the cpcb and other departments of the government are are there to support them but they are it it they have to they have to see that this this policy is there still it will be there and they have to follow it it is a now it is lambda flow i love the blend and if we have to make it success and there is lot of resistance initially in the plastic especially but now now it's it's going well and in other sectors also we have made a portal we we are trying to make it as simple as smooth as possible through online portals you can apply your homes no need to visit offices regularly you are paying need to wait while you have some issues and and it it will be as as as soon as as smooth as possible the upr's status is it is getting it is getting getting more smoother and smoother day by day but as of today it it has it is not as fast it is not as smooth as we expect so i hope that in coming days the not only the recycling business but purchase from the manufacturers out there you get certificates with all bit which will also take speed results to be fast and it will be the targets they have the obligations as well we'll be completed in time i i thank the virtual times for such a workshop because actually they are doing all the work so so this this iec activities information education and communication so so that's why i agreed to come here because the government the awareness the it it is government's work but it is actually the work of society also so they they are our partners in in spreading awareness about this in their policies the problem so that's all what i have to say and time have been interacting with many of you regularly and if there is an issue you can come to us even even now if there are any questions i i'm ready to reply back thank you",

        "content": "now with this may i now invite you would call the of the automotive sector be that is a way of saying that whatever you wanted to do we're done now it's time to notice but i have mister saurabh daleda the investing that doesn't get you here mister willie mehta my friend ramesh and all the distinguished leaders in the human world here please exemplify your position for the wonderful sector in which law work works so when mister the world is looking at automobile sector of india so whenever you go to a government of india's presentation i always try to see the various automobile in it and let me tell you with tremendous satisfaction i am able to locate it in the top 1 or 2 kind of roads that is there it's based in the result a sector that contributes 7 odd percent off to the national gdp and 50% 49% of the size of manufacturing gdp contributing almost giving almost 37,000,000 employment opportunities directly or indirectly that cannot be written off it's most pivotal see that is why i said that in india's growth journey its growth story the most dynamic and most central focus has to be automobile it has to ev is another big game changer so when i talk of ev then i see that the cagr is 49% so every year it is growing by 49% and really there is a sector in indian economy that has growth rate of 49% now i'm focusing on ebl our sense is that in the period between say in another 7 odd years by the time we will be reaching 10,030 our annual sales of ev will be close to 10,000,000 units annually and that is that is going to be 50,000,000 employment opportunities job opportunities directly in that space will be created so this is the reason why automobile is the focus in the national growth story and in that growth story ev becomes so critical so important at neti io there is a national mission on transformative mobility and battery storage i am the mission director my ceo is the mission chief and there is an inter ministerial committee that will take it forward and you know we are always thinking how to take it forward so when we launched the flagship programs of fame fame 1 version 2 that he is strategizing all those things realized teams all those were on the line we knew it well that until we have the buying of the states we will not be able to have so the first state ev policy took 29 months to be positioned after 29 months in the month of september 2017 karnataka was the 1st state to kind of script and release their tv voice we were that was you know it brought a lot of enthusiasm to us in next 29 months 9 states joined the league so that was you know that's all the more positive and in next 29 that is less than that 27 year 27 months almost 19 states joined with that policy with the clear cut policy out of which 3 states decalculated that policy so karnataka uttar pradesh and tamil nadu they revised their policies they upscale their policies and that is how today almost 33 out of 36 states and union directors combined together they are having a huge crisis states view them as something that will bring about investment opportunity that will create a lot of jobs bring them tax revenue expand their manufacturing base and at the end of the day being about prosperity in the state this is the reason why all the investors conference you see the states are trying to locate those investors who are willing to invest in the ev areas this is the reason now if you see that among the states also not as it happens all of them are differentiable and different level are there but what i find an absolute strategy is that want today at least to be partner of broadwares in a digital community and from dt io you must have heard also in your budget there is a new intervention that is started that is called state support mission so in a way kind of you know guiding directing and funding also in a way to these states to come the on the route ahead on the route ahead so one of the offerings that we are planning to make to these states is that how to make them all the more sensitive all the more responsible all the more responsive to the investors to the industry peers in the area of electric mobility so this is you know ladies and gentlemen this is a grand design with which we are going ahead and my sense is that the way it is moving you know whatever targets whatever we are able to see we will be able to not only achieve them but very emphatically surpass them this is what my sense is you know we never expected around 2 and a half 2 years back that the way our ev industry is pushing on today it will be like that okay we did achieve it and when the plis teams were being launched both the plis the way it has the way industry players have responded to it that is again self analysis so for example this pli always give example of this advanced chemistry set and there was a you know where we wanted to take it forward somehow they wanted to kind they wanted to always kind of persuade us to reduce the standards of efficiency because the sense was that you will not get bidders i still recollect one of the one of the foreign embassy officials he said that with this with the with this quality parameters you will not get the bidders so of course i was at dhi and i was i said that okay how do you know that you may not be able to manufacture how do you know that there's no one else who is ready to manufacture it at the same and we'll be willing to give bid for that but anyway you know it was we did not get this heartened of course minister himself was personally presenting that meeting i admit but when the bids were opened and when there was pictures for 130 gigawatt you know that is something else we are supporting 50 gigawatt if each giga works you know there is requirement for 8 100 to 1,000 pro rupees that means with the 1 30 gigawatt there is requirement for 1 lakh 30,000 crore rupees what an amazing confidence that the industry players have imposed on us on the scheme on the on the entire thing that this is going to sail through so this is what you i always take it as the best appreciation for the government ever that so many people they give their gift they typically qualify also not that they don't qualify it's a different thing there because you know you are however the limit was limitations we are bound by that but otherwise they were willing to exist and today there are good number of players which are who are taking it forward not at a giga scale but maybe at a lower scale for the advanced chemistry chip manufacturing now at icat let me tell you that this entire thing this advanced chemistry cell this automobile component use this auto units this entire electric mobility automobile as a as a as a complete you know bigger set of it let me tell you this all of them are technological the technology cannot be you cannot go for anything that is obsolete that is that is that is that has got very little shelf life you have to immediately be on your feet trying to develop new technologies we have done our bit we have persuaded the iits and today 16 out of 23 iits they have opened up centers of excellence and they have crafted some 13 new programs in which 18 interdisciplinary departments have participated this is what we have done for the iits but that is not enough what we have been trying to persuade them is that going to deep research what is the requirement is that get connected to the industry peers ask them for a specific problem statement that they face on their assembly lines fix a time schedule within which you are going to deliver the solutions and of course financial support and all those things and then go ahead because that is what the ecosystem will be you know that will be how you'll be taking it for us so my sense is that we are going to pull off something awesome the only reason is that there is tremendous amount of trust among all the stakeholders all the key players into this ecosystem so by default i would say we work on trust until it is proved otherwise so with that kind of synergy with that kind of team spirit and that kind of sense of trust amongst each other i am sure that in the times to electric mobility will be taking you know leaps and bounds it will be moving and in this mobility journey in this small movement i'm equally shocked that icann will be playing a key role with the help of each one of you thank you",

        "content": "i request our chief guest of the seminar sree rajnish singh sir honorable director ministry of heavy industries governor vijaya to kindly deliver the normal address respected so venujyoti sinazan he has made my job very easy however he has given the complete perspective format of india because dbio is our new tank and they are formulating the policies and other industries are just implementing the policies in coordination with the dbi npi mister akshay munsell from invest india director iket saravailarajee madhini nithaji and distinguished guest most of all i am only 2 years old in this industry so my perspective is something different because i have the award in auto industry i had experience of petroleum industry then railway now i'm in auto industry so first of all this simple question i would like to ask how many are here those who own evs own only 2 or 3 4 now this is the situation right now and there is a potential that we can see that there are prospective buyers also now i think as now i am here as a government representative not a person so whenever i think i think why should government intervenely we should adopt ev what is the government's business to say to adopt ev there are buyers manufacturers and sellers the market values will take care there is a need that is why we are all are here and first of all i consider and i congratulate the times once the times were are landing such type of events because they generate awareness bring all the stakeholders in the one forum and there is exchange of views now as a government i can say that i tried to formulate one policy that is what tli auto and while doing that i passed through the swot analysis of the autoset and yes that is it by sir senior sinasal this is a champion sector in manufacturing industry with more than 35% gdp over the manufacturing now investment used to come in auto sector 34,500,000,000 us dollar came from 2014 to 2019 then what is the need for pli there is a changing approach of the problem we say we will give delivery days for consent you make produce sell then take incentive and we are defining the broader parameters so here i will say ev is one of them and that is the core but we also encouraging ethanol cng lng hydrogen now perspective of ev so whenever i was there i used to confuse between bev and ev then i further deliberated what is bev and what is uv then i'm going through that i came to know when ev is what which is driven by electric power type now power source can be battery or it can be hydrogen so i am taking this journey just start from the batteries then finally what is my firm belief is that hydrogen is the fuel of future and there is a policy for government of india and we are naturally rich we have abundance of solar power and we can generate it is a journey we are transitioning from ic engine to first battery electric vehicle then we will propagate go to hydrogen electric vehicles it may be as to eyes it may be hydrogen fuel cells i doubt you the part i will cover something which i think it should be focused 1 is what is the global's intent we are putting money we are to make india as a manufacturing company and hire a higher domestic valuation why everybody must be well aware we are in amrita in diesel 2040 automotive has been one of the champions it is a focus okay out of which he has been given higher responsibilities auto sector in coming years say 2030 then 2,035 then 2,047 what we are expecting auto sector to generate 25% of the ton more from exports we cannot do from ic we are supposed to adopt the latest technology which are being accepted across the world and more specifically i will say post pandemic so these we are supposed to transition from ic indian where we had always been a follower now during this disruptive phase we see some potential and we would like to become at least not all over the leaders in automotive side icat is there arai grcb all testing centers we have 4 testing centers under amelchaj one was the preventing measure that has been taken immediately and the other was the proactive action in long term for that we have started equipping our test results so in this whole ev what i see potential there is no doubt auto sector has to take the challenge because as a government government has been trying to provide incentive on the demand side charging infrastructure day before yesterday we have sanctioned a major sanction 8002 rupees to 3 of auto sector and we have been championing 2 wheeler 3 wheeler even ssr we have been champion but what technology is lower technologies more lower value products now we are supposed to rise to the higher value chain that is the aim of the government and that is why this session of how is ev driving india's premium mobility has this type of session should have been organized in regular intervals and i will come to select policy tank chamber of commerce and icad icaird has always taken initiative in this type of field and i will wish dan success to this event thank you",

        "content": " to start off i want to request our speakers of this session mister vikrant mohan sir president of all india automobile workshop association to kindly come on stage mister aarindam lahiri sir chief executive officer of automotive skills development council of india has been an instrumental person behind driving skill development in the sector mister mister karthik here president up state rvsf's association one of the young dynamic leader in the space now i also want to invite mister kartik nagpal president rose mehta kartik sir your yeah please come here so and then mister sourav agarwal ganganagar vahan udok sourav sir if you're there please mister jagdish prasad mister jagdish prasad vice in mtc business and mister sanjeev jain v ventures mister sanjeev jain i also request to kindly come on stage mister gopal krishna sir kindly come on stage inaugural session we heard about the policy what the policy stands for how the policy supports different stakeholder the first session post lunch we heard from our oem partners and from netflix and also from niti io in terms of how the supporting stakeholder organizations can play the role what role are they playing and what are the perspectives of the oem now the real hero of the actually entire or the reals nucleus of the entire policy drive that has to be driven are the rbsfs or recyclers whom so we term them because they would but they would be the real pillar behind implementing the policy we will hear from them what they're perspectives are and we are noting all the important points to start off we will go one by one just like the previous session i will go by the sequence that i have in in in the hand 1st i will request all india automotive workshops association since they will also play a very important role in this space vikram mohan sir the national president to kindly address i come from hyderabad automobile line it both challenging line automobile is industry that contributes the maximum revenue to the government of india recognition scrap policy pollution so that means after 8 years we are going to have vehicles on the road which are not road worthy which are bound to make accidents take out the lives of others vintage cars we have a lot of vintage cars policy makers automobile part makers but i represent a community owners maintenance labor percent gst spare parts percent gst thank you thank you so much sir you you brought the exactly opposite side of the table to the point so but we we must hear every views every perspective so may i now go moving forward may i request mister aarindam laidi sir ceo automotive skill development council thank you akram and some parts of it i'll echo with what vikrant here said that i was always wondering what would skill development have in this area but honestly you know this is about 2 years back when i spent a full in one of the registered vehicle scrappage facility to understand what is the kind of skill requirements that are there and we as an organization which is like a nodal organization which works on standards for skilling reskilling and upskilling in this country and specifically for the automotive sector wanted to bring in a course curriculum so that we can teach people how to do vehicle end of life you know disassembly or dismantling and segregation perspective so why do we have that course it's not that we have any major number of takers on this course as of now and it's linked to what is happening around in the industry i'm sure there are lots of pros and cons on either side of the argument and i'm sure this new space which will work out you know internationally this model works maybe we have terminology wise we have used the word scrapping which probably is a little harsh i would say if we can change this to a vehicle recycling policy which can have different use cases it might have a better connotation refurbished materials materials which come out of the of the whole dismantling process i wouldn't say scrapping process but a dismantling process many of them can be used and i was looking at nitinji's presentation earlier today that this is one of the areas that you are all working on and i think it will be very important to work on this because there is a requirement of that part at some part of the country and then is available in another part of the country and how do you match it so some kind of an exchange will be required one of the areas where as an organization which is in 2 skill development where we work with a large number of learners we annually touch more than 2 lakh learners learning various skill development programs on automotive sector we'll be quite happy to bring in the perspective of vehicle recycling or vehicle dismantling or vehicle scrapping whatever we intend to call it to this community because this community itself has the power to bring in huge amount of awareness into the marketplace and we could do it very simply you know there are new technologies which we promote through our various learning management system which are available on our website which get access by more than a lack learners on an annualized basis it could be a platform that you might want to decide to use to reach out to these people to let them know about these facilities where are they located and where are where people can get benefits out of this and what really are the benefits i think every concept that we bring into the table has to have a market value a market mechanism a market economics attached to it no amount of policy honestly is going to make a change and in skill development itself we face the same thing where skilling in this country is not considered to be aspirational but today when we move people who are experienced people who are who are skilled people and they start traveling across the globe to be part of the global work force i think there is a certain amount of aspiration that's coming back to this segment and that is what as a body as a national body one can look to do that it has to make sense to the marketplace the way we work on it it just cannot be based on a that it has to come from within and that requires a certain amount of tenacity in terms of building awareness building aspiration building a perspective around the value that one can offer and it is not just compliance issue i'll give you one last example before i conclude you know in this country there is a concept which is called an apprenticeship and it's not a very popular concept the whole country till about 2018 was doing 2 lakh apprentices just 2 lakh apprentices across all sectors of business that is when the government decided to involve councils like us which are independent autonomous bodies into administration and promotion and awareness of apprentices and when we started working on this from 2018 and today we are about 5 years 2023 we've touched an annual volume of 10 lakh apprentices in this country so we've grown 5 folds we can still grow a huge number there is a huge potential of that but the fact is we've made that journey you know we've started on that journey so on this i would say that we will need to ensure that what works for the marketplace are we able to offer that do we have a tone and manner i i heard such a talk about it that he faced this experience where he felt that somebody is wanting to say no so some bit of a culture change there some bit of a training some bit of an orientation these will be required and as asdc we will be quite happy to see how we can play a role in that thank you very much of course moving ahead now we'll go to straight our rbsfs so to start off katya gergak to kindly give your remarks the president of up state rbsf association thank you so much mister mehta for again organizing this thank you mister amar thank you mister pramod to coordinate this event thank you mister vikrant for your kind words i think so i'm the first rbs to talk about the issues which clearly everyone so without further ado because many but i don't think so i'll have the time to take it forward however like earlier stated by other signatories that had come to this podium they stated that this is a central policy that has that has to be implemented by the state state policies and every state has its own autonomy so all over india they will probably have the same problems and additional problems to their states as well i talk about up so what additional problems do up have up has an additional problem so we are all attending this event to launch the digi elv yeah digi elv is a platform to trade cods now guess what trading cods is not possible in u up right now that is the biggest flaw and this shows that every state has a different problem metric altogether but however let me take this opportunity to briefly mention out a few because there are a lot many in queue who would probably emphasize on that i i'm pretty sure when i talk about the issues i talk about in terms of an a collective issue i'm not talking about myself i talk about a collective issue so first and foremost when people stated that these illegal scrappers don't possess any problem i stict strictly disagree with that now when we are setting up our bsfs a government expects us to put in a substantial amount of resources which need to be countered by the revenue that has to be flowed in now the implementation so the revenue flow for our end and the raw material flow of our end is missing because these legal scrappers possess a faster mechanism because they don't check any documents they process no no operational cost i think so they can cut around 4 5 trucks at at a go which is not possible for us i talk about myself my facility is around 12 gigas so that is some time around 7 to 8 acres so we have put in the amount of resources where we cannot do all of this secondly there is a very big connectivity problem when you talk about rbss the delay in these document verifications is because we don't have proper access or the portals which have been provided to us like wahan ncrb they do not function to its effective efficacy like the productivity of these portals is abstract sometimes as earlier stated by a fellow member he was facing problems in generating cods he was facing in getting these verifications done so these are general problems that everyone is facing all the rbsf's problems and the state wise it differs well i really appreciate a kerala state policy i really appreciate a maharash state policy whereas 45 rvsf 60 rvsf why because there is no stringent policy a maharashtra has only 2 rvsfs allotted based on the kind of resources a person has to offer now not everyone or anyone is feasible to put this because all the environmental issues all the industry issues are meant to be sorted out through this a channel follow gst revenue generate erps or mncs support now moving on to the other problem is as earlier stated by a member of this august house is the age limit so one of the major loopholes between age limit is that rtos register reregister a vehicle for 5 plus 5 years but however on the central motors vehicles act whenever a person is supposed to get a fitness done fitness certificate so how does this match to the re registration done by the rto which is of 5 years so this doesn't get longer government has to give us a policy which states clearly vehicles scrap then on top of that auctions now we are basing our entire what i feel commercial vehicles in the government is the way to sustain ourselves right now private don't if we are being optimistic that we'll get private vehicles through enforcement then i'm sorry that is not gonna happen anytime soon however there has been a guideline that has been flown across government vehicles are to be scrapped now for that there is one issue that we are facing is anyone and everyone is allowed to auction for these vehicles now then again the game comes in illegal and legal scrappers who is allowed to scrap now if we are competing with them we will not be able to sustain however there are benefits which are being offered that gets to be gets me to the other point benefits government offer career what is the implementation on the ground level are the rtos given the proper training to do this are the road tax exemptions that are going through through this policy i'm very sure there are a few places that's happening but majority of places it's not been implemented and once the rbsf claims these are the benefits and we the government does not adhere to the benefits credibility download our credibility is that goes down the drain so what i believe is through mrai or any other association that is being formed they should together and collectively go together towards policy making instead of going individually and posing i don't know n number of points which are endless probably we should go together and solve these problems thank you so much thank you thank you thank you so much mr kartik gedek may i now moving ahead i will invite mr kartik nagpal president rose metra auto recycling to kindly share your views good evening guys first off i want to start with appreciating the central government and specifically more than you know improving the concept of circularity and getting the rbsf policy off the ground the the wahaan integration with rbsf has been relatively smooth that has been my experience and i want to congratulate the mmcm team for the launch of digelv it's a remarkable platform and it is going to have a significant contribution in the contribute significant contribution in improving you know the exactly rbsf problems that we are having it's going to help the elv owners that to realize the value of the cod without actually having to buy a new vehicle that is one of the big things and this is actually going to help the rbsfs in decreasing their acquisition cost so i think digi elv is gonna play a major major role in you know improving and fostering growth in the rbsf industry in in terms of our expectations from the policy i think i can talk about and i think i will be able to echo the sentiments of the rbsf nationwide when i say a lot has to be done and can be done by the government now it's a new industry so it needs to have dedicated support it is necessary to have the support so that the industry can stand its own 2 legs you know and i think that is very important like said like a lot of other people have been talking about there are numerous things that can be done and should be done but i only want to focus on a few 4 5 things that i feel can be done immediately rather than you know talking about changing the constitution vehicles etcetera then the public will think that the government is autocratic etcetera so i feel i have 4 5 initiatives problem solution that as an obvious of winner i'm facing if implemented will really help us because i know everyone is negative right now net negative in the ground and there is no road to profitability but if these are implemented there is a road to profitability there is a path towards improvement because when i talk to mcm when i talk to siam when i talk to mrai i'm very positive that this can happen and because it's a new initiative if all of us can steer the policy in the right way that is the only way this can grow so the number one initiative i feel is education and awareness still there is a lack of public awareness regarding the advantages of selling your elv to rbsfs right now many individuals are selling their elv either out of state or to unauthorized scrappers right without realizing the harm that they're doing to the environment without realizing the risk they're running by not de registering their vehicle then selling it to an unauthorized scrapper so there really need to be a positive campaign towards this so that the public is aware of what they're doing because like in everything else the stakeholders the public is the largest stakeholder and public needs to take responsibility for this we can talk about you know government bringing fine fiscal incentives we can talk about everything else but if today any one of us is asked to sell our own elv at scrap rates we are gonna get heartburn every one of us is gonna get a heartburn when we ask everyone every right so awareness is very very important because and the culture of mindset change is needed because like mister mohan said we are coming from a culture where grandfather's car is given to the father father's car is given there but now the culture needs to change because right now we are you know absolutely abusing the environment the new technology that has come the new emission norms that have come are much better than they were 10 15 20 years ago so we do really need to scrap the vehicle and we need to go on a fleet modernization drive this is gonna not only help the environment it's gonna help the economy as well right so it's a big win for all the stakeholders that is why the recycling policy is there not only just to do it the second thing is implementation of the benefits now the government has announced the incentives with the states for the elv owners that sell the vehicle through the rvsf through the cds right but they're not being implemented right now in most of the states so if they're actually implemented the cod gets value if the elv owner gets the additional money that the government has promised them then it's gonna help the elv owners as well as the rbss alike because again it is gonna bring down the acquisition cost all my solutions are based on 2 things increasing volume for elvs and decreasing the acquisition cost of elvs because if these two things happen we are going to be in a positive growth path the third thing i wanna talk about is the unauthorized scrappers now i understand that this industry has been going on for the last 30 40 years but in a informal way and what this policy aims to do is formalize the informal sector right so the the option has been there and there are cases where the informal sector has formalized and has set up centers and is doing it the right way but still there are so many pockets where unauthorized scrapping is going on and i know action is being taken but most stringent action is needed to take this you know to to a logical conclusion right the 4th i think is a very simple one is logistics cost now globally rbsfs are taking their elbs within a 50 kilometer radius because of due to high inbound logistics cost but in india everything is different right because of the low volume of elvs all the rbsfs are taking from 100 150 200 kilometers also beyond i have a fight with my team always they want to take it from reddy kanyakumari if they can right and they have to take it by cranes etcetera now if we can just have a simple policy where after you paid the cost the elv owner and you have to generate a cod before that you have to transport the vehicle to the yard you can just have some small document from wahaan that takes out that allows it to be driven down this is going to save 10 15% of the inbound cost and it's very simple to you know implement it's not something that needs big changes or comment approvals or committee approvals or something like that and now the 4th one is 5th one is i'm i'm sorry is the selling of the registered vehicles now in any business case that you make you have to have some vehicle park that you base your business out of that you know okay in x city there are such vehicle parks that are going to be deregistered or coming up for scrapping in the next 5 10 years this is what you make a business model but all of a sudden you realize that the vehicle that have been deregistered for not 1 year multiple years can get the noc and be sold out of state that is against the essence of the whole policy and i urge the central government to look into this here how how are we gonna make what base case are we gonna make for setting up a center where if the elb can get a noc and be sold out of state so while we are going the right way you know and i'm positive that the elv recycling policy and the landscape is going to be growing faster but we really need to pause and actually look at what we are doing and where we are going and steer it the right way a lot needs to be done and i'm sure and i'm very positive when i come to these conferences that we are in the right hands and a lot will be done thank you thank you so much mister kartik and you have you have emphasized highlighted the importance of education and dgel we have already launched education series i was just reading while you were speaking they are very very articulately and strategically put all the you know how how they are educating the mass you know because we need to educate the families family members maybe a children who's a college going girl or a boy can influence the family to get the cod and you know to get the old vehicle replaced with a new one so that's again wonderful a big round of applause for dgv again for the education series moving ahead may i now request mister sourav agarwal ganganagar wahan to kindly share your views good evening everyone so i think i'll start by first of all saying thanks to both mrai and mmcm to create this platform for all the rbsfs think this is the first time you know our concerns are being heard by the government and i will hand them to you and one of my first requests through mri will be to do this in a more regular fashion because today a lot of concerns have been heard some of them will be resolved some of them will continue and some new will come up so this regular interaction is is required and thanks for doing this and please continue to do this i think a lot a lot has been already said by a lot of rbss owners here especially kartik i'll in the sense of time i'll try to say those pointers which have not been said until now so i think one thing which i also feel is that you know at state like there's a policy which is content center at state level like from rajasthan the policy is implemented well when the customers are getting the benefits but at state level there is very limited awareness even with the transport department so i think there should be a local agency or within the transport department there should be designated person is that wherever there is an operational rbsf rtls are still cancelling rcs now just understand this so if rc is getting cancelled that vehicle is actually getting dismantled somewhere in a non rbsl or non illegal fashion so if these rc rc cancellations in those places can be stopped rc cancellation automatically if i generate a cod from irbsl rc is automatically canceled you know so that rc cancellation should be stopped that is that is one point which i would like to put i think third point i think i already said but i still repeat it uniformity in tax benefits across various states but central policy has given certain id principles every state is implementing it in a different way the moment this uniformity comes the entire voice of making awareness will automatically amplify so that is i think another request to the government i think one request i'll try to put to cm and oems also is that you know while you know i think i i speaking that how to create more awareness we we have a large dealer body so many auto dealers in every city and i think on an average every auto dealer will have 20 to 30 salesmen and this is the first point where a new customer comes and buys the car and a lot of the customers sell their scrap cars and old cars at these dealer points if these sales teams can be made aware trained and then in turn they can educate customers about the benefits of the policy which kartik said can actually very easily amplify the entire you know discussion around the the benefits of the policy so that's that's my request to cnn and i think last request to mmcn i think i've used this dg ap platform it's operational in operational in rajasthan for a while and i've said this earlier also the entire duration of it so if a new car buyer is looking to buy a cod and at times there is a long wait period for him to you know actually get the auction results so if somehow that can be sorted out or somehow that can be made quicker then it should be responsibility on the guy selling to close close that thing in a certain stipulated timeline and clarity to the optionaire or the buyer that certificate you will this time is very very essential for the certificate to actually realize its site value that's all thank you thank you thank you thank you so much mister saurabh moving ahead mister jagdish prasad vice president m mtc business good evening everyone so i think my fellow speakers have covered most of the points but yeah i think we need to build an ecosystem first of all this is not a new industry which has come for the first time this already exists for the last 30 40 years people have been dismantling vehicles in every corners of town like mayapuri kurla etcetera but only post inception of this policy in september 21 it got a new name called rbsa policy but today it looks a loss making venture for all the rbsa for various regions but going forward it's going to be a lucrative affair for everyone but provided we ensure there's a perfect integration between these different stakeholders and clear transmission of policies right from the center to the ito label if we remove all the bottlenecks then going forward it looks very good for everyone so my submission here is that lot of things are happening nobody's aware what's to be done at except tire 1 tire 2 cities if you go to the other tire 3 cities people are people don't know what's to be done with their old cars and they don't know how to drive benefit out of it they want to contribute towards a sustainable development they want to come to a recycler but didn't know they don't know where to start from so that sort of awareness is required inter state movement of cycle see if an elv is in elv in one state it should be declared elv for other states also but what's happening is due to the lack of policy implementation and strict monitoring on those the the vehicle owners in delhi for example are selling their vehicles to other states so rbs are based out of ncr are not getting benefit out of it so there should be a clear cut monitored centrally you know specifically mentioned policy has to be there so that all the stakeholder holders get out of it now thankfully we have a platform called dzlv which is there to integrate and benefit all the cod owners finally so that kind of more initiatives are required from private parties which can take this policy you know forward certainly thank you thank you so much jagadish sir moving ahead mister sanjeev jain v ventures first of all i thank to everyone for organizing this type of platform use that name rto numbers also and they are selling to them also general scrapers we they sold 131340 vehicle in month of october those generous peoples and all the vikas have been surrendered by atul no one has them thank you the government department they are supporting them secondly no registration will benefit and attacks will not benefit what benefits the article may i re request now mister gopal krishnan appropriator select technology services to share your rbsf guardian scrap main important issue in my opinion discuss why rbsf is here rc cancellation you have mandatory why online system online appointment cancellation misuse immediately drop down i think so 50% immediately data as far as awareness is concerned awareness policy policy policy oem dealers have awareness policies government rbs available oem dealers interested because they are more interested there are number of examples with me thank you so much i think with this we have a lot of points and reputation of lot of many important points out of the discussion i think with this week we come to end of today's session for a group photo what's",

        "content": "i invite doctor r roteesh director simit to kindly deliver your personal remarks event i'm extremely happy that in connection with the location of global recycling day a conference is arranged with the title role of ap around circular economy and post recycle market i come from an r and d institute which spearheads all kind of electronic based recycling we do have a center of excellence on ebs recycling under the umbrella we recycle every product but you know very recently ministry of mines has come out with a critical minerals list wherein 30 materials has been listed this is arrived at based on 2 important factors is the economic importance and scarcity of the material if you see almost 14 critical elements can be recovered from electronic waste as you know that recycling is the last option when it comes to circular economy there are numerous examples which is in front of us one of the examples which i take is from japan where they have started a sound material society right in 1991 and more than 50 percentage of the electronic based is recycled there both you know employing polluter pay principle what i noticed is that most of the extended producer responsibility where it has made success there are polluter pay principles the best example is taiwan where they have a 4 in 1 system recycling system in 1991 taiwan is a garbage island together homemakers united they started an initiative and they have started reducing the you know garbage in the island per capita garbage currently taiwan is only the country where you know epr is you know well adopted how epr is well adopted because one of the problem which i could see in the epr system in india is that there is no fund management if you look at other countries ministry of finance is also an integral part of epr system this is one kind sufficient to the regulators here if you have a fund management system you can very well manage extended producer responsibility because before going for recycling you need to see that how to expand the life cycle of every every electronic product so for currently most of the critical materials are exported i'm sure that many of the people who are here they are exporting battery blackness so we have developed a technology which can recycle lithium ion battery with an extraction efficiency more than 95 percentage and a unity of 98 plus percentage see this is where the post recycling market becomes very very important because we need to look at not only recycling we need to look at up cycling which is its paramount importance if you want to be get a success in recycling arena for example if you recycle lithium ion battery you are able to recover sequentially lithium cobalt manganese and nickel and what to do with that because many of the cobalt or lithium whatever is coming from lithium and battery recycling is not you know suitable for battery manufacturing further battery manufacturing i have been told that many of these lithium carbonate or cobalt oxide are sold in the outside market for throwaway prices where i think most of the recyclers who fail being a a materials laboratory electronic materials laboratory our forte is that we purify the materials up to 7 impurity i'll just take out one of the examples from lithium and battery when you recycle lithium and battery the recovery is almost 98 percentage and purity is 98.5 percentage and per kg cost of a lithium carbonate what you take from recycling is only 9,000 rupees per kg which is used for high temperature grease or things like that whereas if you can to 99 percentage it goes for ceramic application where you have a 3 fold increase in its cost it is somewhere around 30,000 rupees but for lithium and battery manufacturing you will require somewhere around 3 impurity 99.5 plus percentage where the cost is almost 10 fold higher so there should be more focus on roll up post recycle market this is what i want to emphasize notably in lithium and battery recycling technology the morning ashok kumar sir was talking about rare earth extraction all rare earths are come under critical materials i'll just cite a simple example you know we have a lot of monocyte available in seashore especially in kerala seashore we are not extracting where i thought say more than 90% is the permanent magnet which we introduced in all critical electronic application including electric vehicles imported from china you recover new premium outside for that if you want to like you know recover neodymium oxide from monocyte 100 kilogram of neodymium oxide you have to process 10,000 kilograms of monocyte the kind of carbon you know production it generates is huge whereas with the 400 kilogram of permanent magnet you can recover 100 kilograms of rare earth oxide so the depth of technology which is you know underlying the evolution of you know space in the country so i feel that we need to do a lot in this line because already 700,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide reduction is achieved by recycling of the product 17.8 percentage of electronic base which is generated going over on the other speaker was also talking about epr credits you need to include a carbon reduction also this is a very good suggestion so i hope that we need to discuss about all these abstracts about circular economy in the panel discussion so we need to you know go from a linear economy to circular economy still circular economy i feel that rules are not very strong if you look back japan has china has introduced a circular economy rule in 2,009 whereas we are still in the you know implementation stage only so we currently follow a take bake and dispose of strategy i always feel that we are looting and polluting mother earth from there we need to go for a circular economy principle to improve the epr ecosystem country so that most of the electronic waste generated in the country can go for further manufacturing as you know that india is the 5th largest economy and if we want to go further we need manufacturing we are also 3rd you know largest uses of materials so until otherwise you generate secondary raw material with the required purity required quality like we cannot go further so i feel that epr has a very strong role to play in this arena with this i conclude thank you so much",

        "content": "we'll be focusing on decoding impact of ev policy and schemes fame and pli and the speakers for the session i would now like to invite on stage mister akash fase please circle his order president bus division v e commercial vehicles limited mister vinny mehta director general ecma india mister rajiv budraja director general automotive tire manufacturing association capital goods and investment specialist e vehicles invest india government of india this session will be moderated by doctor dave mukherjee managing character omega sici mobility thank you very much kritika and good morning ladies and gentlemen i'm dev mukherjee i am the managing director of omega city private limited we are a electric vehicle manufacturer and i'm very pleased to be here at this event and i thank policy media and icann to having invited me here it's always a pleasure interacting with fellow professionals from the industry and the government etcetera so to begin this session i first of all i invite and welcome the gentleman sitting on the day diocese and i think it's a very good gathering we have representative i think abhishek not such a lot probably he'll join abhishek yep then we we have mister mehta mister bassi and mister rajiv we have representation from the oem side government auto components side so it's a good mix and i wish we have a great interaction anyway i'll start with mister pase you know ev has been a successful start we can say and given the fact that we've just crossed 1,000,000 vehicles in this financial year just to put it in a purse perspective indian car industry became a million industry somewhere around 2012 so it's about you know after after maruti came so you can say 40 i mean 40 years ago maruti came and then it took about good about 25 years to reach that 1,000,000 milestone of course the next million came pretty quickly so from there that standpoint that perspective i think it is a occasion to celebrate occasion to be you know happy that this industry has really taken off and the form factor of 2 wheeler 3 wheeler we can say have been kind of notch better from the start buses have been another success story wherein government came up with i think the the biggest electric vehicle order for 50,000 buses and it is planned in phases so i would request your thoughts on how do you think this ev policy is panning out and and and what kind of impact do you see when we talk about the bus industry because i personally believe that the mass mobility public transportation are key to success of this and i think let me first say thanks for the invitation here icah and policy chamber of commerce policy times chamber of commerce it was very heartening to hear what earlier mister sinan as a policy maker from the heavy industries said i think those are the places where the policy and the directional also meet the expectations then from whichever country we perform in this case in india having said that then for me i represent world war i should commercial vehicles let's say that it's another 2 days to book before the books close business is going well that's why it's possible to sit here it was in terms of yeah saying that you know the economy is looking up and i think it's after a tough covid period there's good times that over the last less than one year we are all now able to assemble and have dialogue with each other so i also have then along with you the honor of having the the industry associations here with the solids like vini and rajiv here so i think we'll get to hear more from them so i will try to keep my perspective more related to the industry yeah which i represent and automobile industry as an oem in general because we will have other viewpoints also so so whenever anything starts off it's always tough and therefore it goes through a lot of challenges i think we had this same story in india if somebody would say if you have to rewrite history what would you do i would only would have liked that we started off in 2012 10 or 12 when china started to take the bait and europe started to put heavy investments so we came on to this platform a bit later but it's amazing to see that over the last 5 years when it really the av story started to move how things have started to shape up in the right direction for a number of us and hopefully most of us are here our technology place and we know about technology so i think i wanna start off by saying that of course there are a lot of things how the policy goes how much we are making not making selling not selling but in terms of electric i think the biggest challenge is that we all live in a tropical country and introducing electric in a tropical country is not an easy scenario with my 25 plus years of experience with the volvo group around the world and with ayesha and volvo in india we we've always been discussing for many years is it right that with this kind of heat temperatures we have here especially in summers what is technology work or would it not or would it create a unsafe situation for people so i think with that background i do say that over the last 5 years we've had an amazing success in this area in the automobile industry then of course i think it's very natural that the small things will get tuned to electric faster so my personal opinion is why is it already that every 2 wheeler or 3 wheeler not electric or most of them so i think but it's great to see as as was said on the dice also here that 2 wheelers and 3 wheelers really the the cagr of 49% probably is driven from there because the volumes are really adding i think that'll happen soon cars have started and trucks are still a challenge because there we carry load and is a battery the solution or is just one of the solution i think that question still needs to be answered and maybe the io has started to define how long we can on the truck side create some island of excellence on the bus side i think that's where the biggest success is coming not only in india i think when china started being having the possibility in my earlier role to chair 2 companies in china we were in one of them making more than 4,000 electric buses a year already about 7 8 years back so i think that's where also the success story came in buses in europe also success story came in buses and i can tell from my experience that as volvo we don't make any diesel electric sorry diesel city bus of any in europe anymore everything is only electric diesel stopped about 4 to 5 years back perhaps yeah so and and because it's mandated every city in the center wants an electric product to be there and emission to be 0 so i think it was a very natural call of why if you look at got it and if you look at policy papers same subsidy is already 100% used in this whereas in other automobile sectors there is still a way to go and that is the reason that it's a success because it's about people and it is able to the technology on buses we are able to create in the neighborhood so already today there are over 20,000 electric buses which have been ordered most of them that have been ordered and are being put in being designed manufactured sold operated all by the oems themselves to the various cities of india or the various state corporations that also brings in some challenges which i will talk of later but that's a great success i think going forward of course that's not a model model which can continue because that is where an oem can on its balance sheet take certain amount of investment to work with what the government wants to work and that's been a success but overall talking there as before coming back again later i think if there is any technology which is a story for the future at this moment it's electric many other things are being spoken but that's where the biggest damage will change you in i was a little surprised when we were only 1 or 2 of us who had an electric vehicle so i don't think the question was an electric car i guess that if you have a long motor at your home which is electric today or a 2 wheeler at your home which is electric today so there are number of things coming onto electric and that would spread overall across the value chain in the automobile sector thank you thank you very much joe i think you very aptly put the success story is the technology maturity today battery is the most mature technology tomorrow it may be hydrogen or whatever i we don't know and within battery of course there are various chemistries evolving but i think the mature mature technology has been taken ev story is successful and successfully panning out in india and as you rightly pointed that this is where i think yeah has a clear map now on the economic side we'll talk later and we'll come to that economic model and whether it is successful or what more can be done now i'll come to mister bedi mehta so you have been spearheading the auto components industry and representing in big forums for a very very long time now automotive is a very material intensive industry and also traditionally it has been you know organized in this k tiered manner tier 1 tier 2 tier 3 etcetera raw material suppliers so given the back backdrop of ic engine industry now this industry will obviously migrate or transit to non fossil fuel and probably battery would be one major sir from you what are your thoughts on this ev policy sir from you what are your thoughts on this ev policy and how is the auto components industry gearing up for this setting up capacities technology developments r and d etcetera because you know the scale cannot come without this industry getting ready so your thoughts on the subject please thank you thank you dave and thank you once again good morning again i mean i was there and very interesting 2 question that you asked me see from a policy perspective and from a will of the government's perspective these are very interesting times because every single forum any government leader whether it is mister nathan galkari or i guess mister piyush goyal they're going hammers and tongs for localization so much so they call out the oems and say you better localize so it augurs very well for the domestic component manufacturers i haven't ever seen in my short life any of the governments talking so vociferously about globalization also you look at the fame scheme when the fame one came out it was accompanied with by another scheme which is called the pmp scheme you know and and that was borrowed from the earlier years i come from the electronics industry and we had a pmp scheme there you know so in some sense that was brought back and the dli scheme is again very much based on the the the localization aspects of the pmp in the fame one scheme and if you know the pli scheme apart from the fact that you have to invest 250 crores to qualify it and that you have to grow 10% year on year you also have to do a local value addition of 50% okay so in some sense the government is driving very significantly what comes to localization also when you look at the overall technology road map the government is not putting all eggs into one basket ev is one of the technologies that is being promoted in our quest for that overarching goal of 2017 there are many other technologies that are there whether we are talking about alternate fuels we're talking about biofuels we're talking about mhmm zlg and and then of course the the hydrogen thingy that's very very recent so in some sense the government is leading to the market forces to decide what technology eventually succeeds but in some sense a very democratic way of going about things you can always count counter argue and say that hey you know we may need to probably pick up our technology because our resources are limited and you know if we were to sort of say like the china went about it saying they're just still going hammers and tongs about ev okay i i do not know what will eventually succeed but at this juncture the excitement that is there in the ev space is phenomenal i also want to allay for you as i said earlier on you know it's only the powertrain that undergoes a change but the rest of the material as you said remains but again in the ice space there is going to be a lot of technology changes that we have to gear up and i think light weighting is something that is an evergreen thingy whether we want to make the ice vehicles efficient or any of the other technologies efficient you have to go into light weighting so these are very interesting times from a technology perspective yes it's not that everybody is ready our transformation is gonna be a huge huge challenge because the auto component industry has a very long and fact we'll have to see to it and and therefore we are suggesting to our members to also they're actively now pursuing adjacencies i'm doing i do very regular tech shows with the oems i've done with ashokullen i've done with tata motors i'm doing i've done with hero elect hero motor car i've done with the hyundai and all of these by the way are also for electric vehicles okay not just for the conventionalized vehicles but now i'm doing a a tech show for chennai railway corporation chennai metro railway corporation because a lot of the traditional industry the powders that is in casting in some of the other traditional areas plastics making of seeds can also be looked at adjacencies such as aerospace such as the railways such as the defense drones and the drones of course so we are sort of a catalyst trying to enable but only the time will tell how the industry sort of grabs those opportunities but we can't be more enough thankful to the government for what they have done at this juncture in sort of handholding the industry when it comes to the electric mobility so yeah i'll i'll end this here yeah i think we thank you very much and you have rightly rightly explained what the industry what what the industry is what the industry is doing and how it is sort of setting the phase for the future government is probably we are seeing you know creating the whole framework the infrastructure and facilitating both on the demand side as well as on the supply side by their various intervention fiscal and non fiscal so and and obviously auto components industry is one of the key you know stakeholder in making this success so taking this discussion forward mister rajiv i would again you represent the tire industry which is again a very very critical and important part of the auto male automotive vehicle industry again a complex industry in terms of technology products and also entry barriers are high and and i think a lot of big players the big brands are already here so coming into this whole position to electric so what are your thoughts on this whole framework that is being developed by government through the ev policy and and since there is a environment angle also you know sustainability environment side as well so i would request your thoughts from the perspective of your industry into this thank you very much thanks to icart and the policy times for inviting let me start with mentioning that you know whatever goes under the hood of the vehicle whether it's a car or a bus i think where the vehicle meets the road the point of contact is going to be tires so in a way we'll start with the advantage if i may say that all the disruptions and the uncertainties are not going to be there at least for the tire industry because we keep rolling you know the vehicle definitely need tires yes at least in the foreseeable future i don't know what lies ahead beyond 20 70 but until then i think we are in a somewhat if i may say a comfort zone but it's not so easy also let me mention 2 or 3 very key aspects you know that would resonate with the thoughts that were expressed in the inaugural session and i'm referring to you know 1 of course the disruption that was talked about in terms of the new induction of technology that's a very big you know game changer second of course is the domestic capacity and capability the localization or the self reliance that has been talked about and 3rd to take it to the next level in of how equipped are we to take on the world and i think on all these three kind of of railroads tire industry seems to be at least historically also and by virtue of you know the natural organic progression that has happened in a fairly if i may say responsible position because you know taking in the reverse order you know we went through very very difficult closing this year this financial year with almost exports of 25,000 crores now for an industry which is 75,000 crores it's almost 1 third of the your turnover industry turnover or revenue and as was mentioned by the director at dhl in the morning that you know one should be looking at almost 25% kind of exposure to the world outside to you know more as a means of self evaluation as to how your industry is doing so i think we have ticked that box already and and bracing ourselves for the challenges ahead coming to the localization you know and as winnie mentioned again there is complete clarity from the government that notwithstanding you know whatever has been the import profile and for whatever reasons whether it's the presence of the mncs here looking at imports as a model i think the signals from the government are very very clear that we are going to be looking at domestic manufacturing not just for india but india to cater to the rest of the world also so i think there again i think majority i would say barring very very few exceptions you know of of some very specialized categories for defense or maybe some in the off road segment all other tires are being domestically manufactured and including the new range and the new generation of vehicles in the electric space so i think there again tire industry has collaborated and supported the oems in ensuring that at least their plans be it on whatever fuel you know that goes into the vehicle whatever technology that is going under the hood at least the vehicles are being rolled out and i think you know in going forward i think this journey is only the beginning the everybody realizes that you know the decarbonization transport sector it's not just a matter of discussion the time is for action and as mister kwasi said we we were late starters or we are late starters but we need a lot to catch up with but i think the overall the second ones are very positive for the country as a whole and the sector that we are in thank you thank you very much yuv i think you have captured the points very well and of course the the macro levels if we talk about them this is related to the whole decarbonization reducing the carbon footprint etcetera where there is a definitive goal you know 0 carbon emission by 20 70 by 2030 the energy side government has taken a target to achieve 50% by renewables i think and and then automotive is a subset of that automotive evolves from there because in terms of impact if you say that automotive is probably the the biggest impact in terms of more than 30% emissions etcetera you know tailpipe emissions etcetera so i think you captured it well and you also talked about the the the focus of the government on making india and i would like to dwell more on this subsequently with miss shubhini as well because i think this is where the whole success story will eventually pan out and this is a very very profound you know force multiplier in terms of technology in terms of social impact etcetera so i'll come to mister akash so you we we talk let's talk about the opportunities and the challenges so interestingly in the context of any industry when we talk in the context of india then we always say opportunity challenges are in equal proportion you know because that that's where that's how india operates being a very large diverse country so when we talk about this whole electrification transition etcetera and the opportunities are phenomenal you know we learned about the budget being sanctioned money being rolled out infrastructure being built etcetera so what are your thoughts on the opportunity side as well as the challenge side particularly if you talk about the economics of it so i request your thoughts on this so a couple of things again i think this year we would do as volvo and i share about over 75,000 trucks and buses yeah few 100 of them would be electric and but in terms of investments probably it is skewed on the other way that the input investments going in are 60 70% skewed towards new technology right like electric and hydrogen and therefore it's very clear the output in a couple of years will be so let's always talk of opportunities because challenges are always ready and open my paper i think i have a full page with challenges maybe when you run start to put opportunities you normally end up saying one line line or two lines but let's start like this and i say this with a very good taste you are sitting here because of the omega psycho omega psycho otherwise in the automotive field of automobile so this is a possibility for a number of new thinking companies to come and create brands to come and create new technologies and offer services to the people probably and hopefully as a profitable proposition so i think that is the largest opportunity which this change always offers and then as they say change is always change changing so growing up i only know of the tata and the ayesha and the and the mahindra and so on and so forth 22 years back as the first employee who run that business set it up as in india and with that i can say that there were i don't remember when i've been in cii sorry you have to i don't remember that ministry of heavy industries as an example ecma ecma myself as an oem yourself as an oem or others sitting together and talking things together absolutely it would only happen the anetna will convince you or the skyman will convince you but today every 3rd or 4th day or as any other manufacturer we do not only we want you to do everything ourselves today very clearly the way forward around the world and which is also happening in india even if we want to do everything ourselves is to work with partnerships collaboration that is collaboration that is where for us become extremely important because we cannot invest in everything we cannot do everything ourselves we cannot be the most important out there so i think the last opportunity is that there are many more if i stop at opportunities digitization digitization even for us in the commercial vehicle space has changed life from april 2020 when bs 6 came in every truck bus or road is digitized you can get in touch with the driver you can say how does the driver behavior how is the transmission behaving how what is the battery power being consumed or the diesel being consumed is somebody stealing the diesel or not you want to reroute the driver to go have a bus or truck so i think i'm talking on commercial vehicle it's probably step step up on on on the other preventive maintenance because breakdown maintenance was what we did because i remember starting well since 22 years workshop and then it was decided to explain to people that if you have a good product you don't need a workshop every 5 kilometers and i think that is india today over 4,000 kilometers north to south and there's not a workshop everywhere but products are running because of good ivs and industrial big challenges so i'll spend a couple of minutes there i think that of course government has global coverage to me i am on emissions government is there for public good we are also there for the same but at the same time we are also there for creating a profitable business for our stakeholders so that is where as private companies we differ a bit so we have today then on our agenda the ice engines which is diesel then you have electric then there's copper hydrogen fuel cell then we we spoke outside of ethanol being part of diesel we spoke of cng being there we're speaking of hydrogen i see engines coming in now so it's always a challenge how much should you address what will succeed where should you invest let's still keep you there because end of the day rois have to be yes so i think that's a big challenge then coming specifically to electric i think it's been a great story on the bus side but one reason why it's a great story in india and the world over is that the policy maker is the other the purchaser also in one way or the service provider on one way is also developed so there the value chain starts from them and it ends from them and that brings also again a challenge because myself or a short lived in the subway we can make thousands of electric buses give it to the cities we are designing them ourselves we're manufacturing them ourselves we are selling to our own mobility service companies we are running the muscles we are servicing the muscles we're putting charging infrastructure muscles in government depots and that's very good because in the beginning you need to do that but high low so the the challenge with this is then end of the day i'll provide that service and i've paid for that service in a state by a state corporation which in itself probably most of the cases leaving good examples in delhi and gujarat and maybe selected few is actually a high loss then i do everything in the so if i keep my trousers out for 6 months like that it'll be a great job so i think that is where government needs to then support the next step how to bring in private operators into it how to make component manufacturers also a bigger part they already are in some way part of the whole story on the inside and outside how to have finances operators and others become part of the story and not only we then of course there is a challenge in electric that is of circular economy so i think that is not so much of the table today so i think i'm just focusing now on the big things the big ticket items and lastly let me say lastly the incentives have to continue for some time we can't say that okay now we've seen 10 percent of penetration in electric in cars maybe 30% in evs 2 wheelers or 3 wheelers and maybe almost a high percentage of buses so we've done a great job let's stop it here so if we have to continue with the change it the government support must be acquired it's still not standing on its own and in our industry we see the biggest challenge in the truck industry because the loop doesn't close from government development the loop closes at companies like ours or others buying material and then bringing your trucks with the material right nobody wants to pay more but we want to have environment on focus which it should be and there are no two ways about it so some of these things i think hello with everyone can we sort it out nothing stops india from being the largest tv manufacturer in the years to come yeah yeah thank you akash i think you have sort of put the whole package together you know we have to we have to talk and there has to be dialogue like you said with the stakeholders to make this business viable for for everybody and and sustainable for everybody sometimes you know of course there is a cutting down the per kilometer cost etcetera which is great but again we it profitable over in a calibrated manner of course there has to be you know investments on both sides so i think you've captured that very well so coming to vini i just want to touch upon another opportunity and which is the social part of it and it's not really talked about so much the human resources the skill development etcetera and i think as the technology sort of jumps in a very big way and i am associated with iits and some other institutes and i always tell them you know you know the curriculum needs to undergo rapid sort of change now so that's at the not not only the engineer but down the line you know there are mechanics the people who repair the vehicle take care of the vehicle so i'd like to know your thoughts and how do you see the opportunity panning out because you are i mean the auto industry is a very large employer you know we're talking about something like 40,000,000 people directly and probably several million indirectly into the whole supply chain so how do you think about this opportunity your thoughts please so i would say that you know when you're talking about an industry that is moving into a technology space and i would say the human capital becomes really very very critical you know so it's no longer a resource it becomes a capital okay and definitely i would say there's a huge gap today between what is existing and what we need and it is not just looking from the the the the transformation of the industry only from a product perspective but also looking at the way the manufacturing manufacturing is transforming into a digitized manufacturing so what we have done is atmos iim together fada we have floated sdc which is the automotive skill development council together with the nsdc okay and we now have curriculum that addresses these areas both at the manufacturing level and also looking at the product level and they are now they have now sort of the empanel institute that deliver the curriculum is developed by the industry we have gotten together to develop the curriculum and then these are now sort of the empanel institutes that develop the curriculum it's a complete online system where people take you know go to the curriculum take tests assessment is done and thereafter sort of we make available those resources available to the industry that's one level also while it's not yet moved as dynamically we've also sort of started working at the technicians level from an aftermarket perspective yeah and what we are doing is we have right now it's a mammoth exercise they're creating a database of technicians and mechanics okay and thereafter 1 you are going to sort of sec sort of segregate them in in in in terms of the feedback from the industrious to categorize them and thereafter do some degree of a training for them but it's much easier said than done because that's a very mobile resource not necessarily that stays on but we're hoping because the mobile numbers would stay on for some time because this is all a mobile based intervention that we are trying to do because they don't have access to emails and stuff like that right so there's an attempt being made but that's a huge ocean in that space but as you say there's a huge huge opportunity that exists my the hope and my wish is that people will take human resource very very seriously i don't think see them doing it as seriously one of the things is that at least from a conventional industry perspective in the last 10 years you know i've seen because of the cost pressure the the the we had something like if i may say 5050 of a contractual and 50% of regular employees and that's now suddenly become sharply 70 30 where 70 is contractual and 30 is your regular and as you go down the tiers let's say in tier 3 you do not have a single regular employee it's the owner and all contractual right and when you move into these kind of structures you are not investing enough because again because it's a mobile resource the contractual labor you're not making enough and more investment in skilling those people and believe you with the industry you'll suffer in the long run so that is something word of caution at least from my part of the vertical that i come in it's not as much of a challenge in the oems but then definitely in the value chain it's gonna have a detrimental impact and one must be very wary of it and one needs to make sure that we take corrective actions otherwise when we move into a technology industry we're gonna suffer very valuable i think it's it's very pertinent point that you made that it is very important to to the the kind of scale that we are talking about you know 10 years 30 years down the line and to prepare the industry industry for that what is coming i think in the technology change that is going to happen the roles will be different the responsibilities would be different and you know for example a mechanic handling an ic engine versus a ev is entirely different ballgame in terms of complexities safeties etcetera so i think this is something very big i would say opportunity for the industry to really you know build its resources build the firepower you know sort of for for the new vehicle technologies that are emerging very well put sir so mister rajiv again the same question i would like to know what are your thoughts on the opportunities as well as challenges from your perspective you know what do you think needs to be done and where are the big challenges coming well coming from the podiums where mister akash said he could list out t plus and then when he as the component industry i think i will representing only a part of that value chain confine myself to only maybe 2 or 3 big ticket you know challenges first of course being that automotive value chain somehow you know in the and tire as it is you know being a raw material intensive product you know on the other hand it's not just the small grower fraternity when we are looking at our other raw materials be it synthetic rubbers or carbon black or chemicals again we are you know connecting with the the giants of the industry the alliances and the you know aditya birla group for carbon black and so and so forth so that i think is is a tough call by itself you know doing that act so on the opportunities i would say that as was mentioned digitization you know and then the example of the earlier era of the seventies and the current you know the automobile industry landscape that has been given today again you know thanks to you know the embedded technologies people are expecting you know at least pertaining to tires and tpms to be built in as a part of the the vehicle you know navigation and it's also you know going to be prompting tire companies to look at alternate models you know not just buying tires as a one time investment but actually looking at a pay per use tires or something you know yeah on a cost per kilometer basis so as technologies get both evolved and adapted and become a part of the vehicle dynamics i think those offshoots would emerge and surely we would be looking at those areas of opportunity as well very well so i think this this is a very important point you know of although your industry is kind of agnostic to the ic or any other technology but still i think the the impact of these emerging technologies particularly the digitization and how ai being talked about in a big way so we have to see how it pans out so these technologies cut across all you know products and services and that is where i i think innovative products will come into the market wherever you play that's what i believe that these are the new dynamics that are running out in the industry and ev provides that much better in terms of opportunities where you can have battery battery as a service swapping as a service etcetera so those are the some of the new opportunities but altogether i think it's a it's a great you know time to be in so just one last comment from you before we request the audience for some question what would you like to say about this industry i mean the government policies etcetera and where do you think more needs to be done yesterday i had the opportunity to be in the right essocham conference and we heard the minister talking about the big highways coming up and you know it all sounds great so what are your thoughts on on this whole let's say new decade of a new india if we can say that so your thoughts please i think i've already said much so the only thing in a couple of minutes from my side i think we're all focusing is not the only way to hit to that dimension there is others probably in the long run hydrogen will become more effective right however however i always say let's stay in the moment and in the moment at least in the next 10 year perspective at least it's very much at the emi space if you look at any manufacturer globally including us as volvo or aisha we are deep into the electrician the whole supply chain is being developed like that our investments have been keeping that in mind is on the floor we we didn't talk about it but i think mister raji will you do out that will be that will be the future so everything around us is changing and and clearly ev when it comes to technology on automobiles and this part in spite of all the challenges it brings is the way forward skilling is very important because otherwise most of us will lose our job you can see at my age i have to bring in a few papers in case i forget what do i need to see and we have the young mini here who just walks violin you know it's all in the mind so that's what the young generation is about well he's not all like young well he's not on like young so the young generation coming in today has very different expectations for and i am sure everyone here faces in the field of automobiles how we thought and how we came in as so called graduate engineer trainees today they come in with a different board it's very difficult to retain it's very cheap talk of because words that trouble will solve themselves it's been a 100 years since ic engine is there and even today we have workshops to take care of vehicles if they fail right and this is just the start of the electric journey in india over the last 5 years absolutely right akash and very well said so we need your thoughts on the last comment and what would you like i suppose i'm lucky to be alive like all of you we made it to the pandemic and very very exciting times as akash said there are numerous opportunities we must work towards them i i think as indians we tend to celebrate a little too early so we need to really put our heads together to work towards the vision and once we've achieved we can really go all out and celebrate so that's about it yeah but there's a huge i mean the good thing is that we are much more confident than we were 5 years ago or 10 years ago but we should channelize it in the right direction so i i guess that's you absolutely right rajiv your thoughts well like akash i'm the old school so even if i have nothing to say i feel comfortable having my peoples around me but having said that i think what i would leave it as a thought would be that while the government direction and the you know policy guidelines are quite clear i think there's still room to make them slightly more if i may say nimble footed or flexible in in sync with the experimental times that we are in you know because this is a road that has not you know traveled before so there are you know pit stops where we need to take a pause and look back and i think that's where probably the expectation from the government is a little more from the industry side also like it was mentioned in the morning say 30 odd states or 22 states have their own ev policies you know again instead of you know joining the bandwagon perhaps it's good time to kind of you know take a pause step back and review what has worked what hasn't you know right and that would be i mean those are the kind of areas that one should start deep diving and and kind of adjusting the doing the post correction that's going on absolutely right mister adiv i think it's time to you know even though feel happy maybe even celebrate but i think introspection of what has gone wrong what what all needs to be done because it's a very large industry and very very significant change that we are going to see in the next 5 to 10 years so so just to conclude the discussion today you know we we had an excellent you know thought provoking discussion thank you very much akash rajiv thanks a lot and i would like to thank icad for giving us this opportunity",

        "content": "i we are we are so happy and thrilled to have your excellency mister satoshi sasaki officer in charge ielo decent work team for south asia and country office for india sir we will because we all know what ielo does we will hear more from sir what your excellency what ilo india office and southeast asia office is doing in addition to conveying the message of workplace safety and health so our special guest of honor all your excellency sir thank you very much for the introduction good morning dignitorial dias and participants and industry colleagues i'm delighted to join you today on the occasion of the world day world for the safety and contribute towards the discussion on potential of the ev sector as a growth engine of india to do so i would like to bring your attention to 3 key areas which can help the ev sector to be a significant contributor to the indian economy 1st today is the day the world's safe day and this year theme is about promoting and enabling safe and healthy working environment for all in june 2022 last year at the 110th international labour conference of the ilo the delegates from the 186 member countries adopted the inclusion of the principle of safe and healthy working environment to the ilo's fundamental principles and rights at work this means that member can including india obligated to work towards making progressive improvements to promote safety and health for all workers irrespective of the the level of the economic development in a country the io declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work which was adopted for 1998 had initially recognized 4 fundamental rights at work which are freedom of association and effective recognition of the rights to collective bargain and second the elimination of all forms of force for compulsory labor 3rd the effective abolition of china and force the elimination of discrimination in the spectrum of employment and occupation these rights are inseparable intellated and mutually reinforcing as the 5th principle of the fundamental principle of right of work ensuring safe and healthy working environment now enjoy a similar relationship in this context india should also explore a of the 2 core osh conventions osh means occupational safety and health osh conventions namely occupational safety and health convention 1981 and promotional framework of occupational safety and health convention 2006 and this brings to the second area of my discussion enabling fair and sustainable supply chains for the ev sector in trade negotiations notification of the iowa core conventions a way for the country to demonstrate their capability of ensuring protection of workers while ratification of convention including occupational health conventions enabled greater acceptability of the products manufactured in the countries and exported to the global market for the ed sector to be a lead runner contributing to the domestic and global economy decent work needs to be ensured not just in the large enterprises but down to the supply chain reaching up to the 2nd and third tiers of the suppliers that gives more challenges for the industry related to labor raw materials and production processes the supply chain needs to be fair and sustainable and on promoting this at work and fundamental rights of work including occupational safety and health participation of businesses in global supply chains can enable many passes for the the development of the country including employment technology advancement and transport skilling capacity enhancement diversification and so on and that opens towards the fbi and this brings to me the 3rd area of my discussion where ev sector can be a driving force to create cleaner jobs and build a skilled workforce which will contribute towards the the cleaning of the economy and reducing emissions and carbon footprints by responsibly managing the environment and skills and clean energy for the ilo the concept of the green jobs summarizes the transformation of economies workplaces enterprises and labor market into a low carbon sustainable economy that provides decent employment opportunities for all the renewable energy and jobs annual review report 2022 by the ilo and international renewable energy agency recognizes that the the the worldwide employment in renewable energy is 12,700,000 india shares 7% of such zones so the employment potential is going to immense the shift to a low carbon and sustainable society must be equitable it must be a just transition it can it cause in in case of in the sector like many other sectors there are changes that are needed it is imperative that the policies should be put in place to ensure that those likely to be negatively affected are protected social dialogue is a critically important component of a just transition especially in the work place where the voices of both employers and workers are needed to determine the the design of the new sustainable production systems and well practices in some instances the project workers begin to work together in cleaning their workplace building on the long tradition of collaborating on occupational safety and health and other issues this movement towards the green economy has created more opportunities for clean technology green and green jobs this requires human capitals including women and workers from the vulnerable communities use marginalized groups to be skilled rescaled and upskilled to match the requirement emerging in the labor market this can help inclusive at development and contribute towards more and better employment greater return on investment on training and increased productivity finally i thank you and the the ministry of heavy industries to invite me today on the occasion of safe day and discuss about potential of the ev sector as growth engine i wish you a productive discussion today thank you very much",

        "name": "Welcome\u29f8Theme Address\u29f8Shri Saurabh Dalela \uff5cCan the EV Sector be India\u2019s Next Growth Engine\uff1f",
        "content": "may i request doctor amil ashish saurav dallila sir director international centre for automotive technology to kindly give the welcome and team remarks thank you mister afram and thanks everyone for being here dignitaries on the dais my dear friends from media my dear friends participating in this very important theme seminar can the ev sector be india's next growth engine the outset i welcome all of you at icad this is a icad centered 2 campus which is close to 47 acres of land and we have another campus at icad campus 1 which is about 7 kilometers from this place so heartiest welcome to all of you to this wonderful place and amazing place all the engineers especially where it's it's a kind of innovation lab for us so i just welcome to all of you this is a very important event and going forward i think the importance and the gravity would keep on increasing and magnifying for the simple reason that this is the new transformation that india is going to see we've already heard our joint secretary mentioning about this very clearly that there is absolutely no compromise in going back on the commitments that we've made on 2030 and 2017 so the vision is all set it's just that how all of us sitting here and outside are going to make it happen strategies that we're gonna make it happen government is gonna play its role we have to play our role everybody has to play their role just to give you a couple of numbers we are about 1,400,000,000 evs today and by 2030 cumulative number is likely to be 45,000,000,000 that's a cagr of 49% unprecedented growth absolutely unprecedented we've never seen such a growth in any dimension number 1 number 2 the component industry is gonna be about $14,500,000,000 that's another big one that is about to come 10,000 crores of investments by the indian government already done by the fee scheme of fame and another big one to to be coming up in the bli scheme look at the strategy when the fame started the basic objective is that we all started to talk about ev there was a lot of there there were a lot of startups that started there there were a lot of new players who came into the business game and the government promoted them not only with money but otherwise from from regulatory point of view as well and and there were a lot of boost to this kind of a startup initiative of the government and now with the pii we are expecting more technologies to come into india and that's an important piece because in the days to come the r and d budget which is going to be around this auto sector in 2030 is likely to be 14,000 crores just the r and d center and and it's important to understand why because when we say make in india it's not just assemble in india and that's what i think it's been said in various forums and i'm just kind of reiterating the whole theme so that it doesn't get wiped off from our minds it's not only make in india or assemble in india or import and assemble in india it's primarily research in india make a product for india and any product that is good for india i guarantee it's good for the world the vice versa is not true by the way products that have been designed for japan for korea for us for europe for any other country may or may not function well in india because of various conditions of you know climatic variations that we offer the road conditions that we offer the driving habits that we offer here are are far too different and therefore anything that has done great in the middle east will do good here but anything that is good for india will do good everywhere so it's very important to design for india because of the reason that i just said and if that boost comes in it's going to be a great journey and very clear we don't have to ask this question that we are talking today can the ev sector media's next growth engine we are very sure it is going to be it is going to offer huge employment opportunities it is going to offer huge opportunities on research and innovation we are ranked close to i think 50th in the world on the innovation index i'm eyeing on something which would be just about less than 20 in by 2030 with these initiatives not only by the government but also from the new startups also from the oe manufacturers also from the component manufacturers also maturity in terms of the customer range and of course the government whose various sectors and departments boost in this and the commitment is very clear no going back on that another important piece here is the safety part and this is where i think all of us have to be very very careful you see if if you don't have your ic engine properly managed on heat nothing great happens the engine ceases the piston melts piston rings go off there are no fires there are no deaths there are no there are no fatalities it's all repairable we can do it of course there's a boss but then still it is manageable but if a similar thing happens in an ev the the reputations are really very difficult to handle it's highly unsafe we have fire we might have fatalities and therefore safety becomes a very very important issue when we enter into the zone and this is where i want to i i request everyone to put a little bit of additional caution not a little bit of a maybe a majorly a huge amount of caution on the thermal management of evs because if because we are india first of all we are not us or europe or japan where the temperatures are lesser and anything that goes well over there may or may not work here for sure so recently tesla had this octane wall i think they've patented it with it's got 8 ways of coolant and refrigerant and heating management they have to heat the batteries because the temperatures are subzeros over there and this is doing very well over there it's a patent technology and but then for sure 2 sectors of the 8 out of 8 are not required in india just going through it and they are not required in india because of our conditions over here might be required by the army because they go at high altitude and lay in the dark areas but otherwise you don't really need them so such things which are going to create safety hazards are going to be more immediate and therefore we have to be all very careful with this part of thing when something goes wrong in a ic engine the performance gets hampered whereas if same things go wrong in an ev the safety gets hampered and that's a area of concern for all of us we don't want unsafe situations performance we can argue we can debate we can increase efficiency even today we are increasing efficiency of ic engine that's okay that's good that's great transformation but safety is something which is we have to be very careful so with this clear message i welcome once again all of you and i am very confident that end of the day we will mister atram go to conclude very clearly that this is the place to be this is the time for all of us this is the moment for all of us next 8 years i tell you are going to be absolutely exciting for all of us and we should cherish all these moments and especially an engineer for sure this is going to be your day and your time thank you so much",

        "content": "miss ayesha ayesha ramin mal who's the executive director of omi much i'll cap the ministry of heavy industries policy times for inviting me to present my views on how the ev sector can be india's next growth engine respected dignitaries on the stage and friends in the audience thank you so much again for this opportunity as well as for your patience listening i wish to specifically focus on feminizing the ev sector to propel india's growth the electric mobility ecosystem of course is very poised for robust growth in the country and will emerge as a key employment generator onboard day for safety and health at work 2023 i'm honored to speak at the india ev seminar and highlight the historic opportunity the india ev ecosystem has for all of us as we all know and like tightly pointed out by the speakers before me the promise of electric mobility in india is immense beyond delhi the growth for ev adoption is huge regardless of the size and characteristics of cities the willingness to adopt evs by denizens across the country is huge recently in omi foundation was able to release its flagship study called ease of moving index india report 2022 the ease of moving index is an evidence based framework developed by us at omi foundation to measure and benchmark mobility in cities through the index our organization endeavors to create mobility baselines for cities benchmark improvements achieved on each mobility parameter over the years with a special attention to electric mobility as well and we found that cities like andaba jammu and so many others that we studied demonstrated high willingness to adopt evs our study involving india's largest mobility service spans 40 cities across 25 states and 3 union territories covering 110 plus indicators metrics of mobility 9 parameters and is representative of 25 percent of india's urban population based on this study we've been able to make ev based and sustainable mobility based recommendations to the cities themselves but back to the topic on feminizing the ev ecosystem lg charging infrastructure sales service driving recycling units collection disposal and so much more but where are our women traditional auto industry has seen higher share of women in electrical equipment and components manufacturing but we are also seeing women break barriers in the 21st century and we are seeing them present on the factory floor as well ola future factory for example is the world's largest electric 2 wheeler manufacturing plant it's fully powered by women it currently employs 2,000 women and is strategically investing and training and scaling over 10,000 women in core manufacturing expertise likewise ampere ev by glebes was started by a remarkable woman in mobility and has 30% women workforce tata motors mahindra and mahindra hero motor corp bajaj and so many others have introduced women on the assembly lines increasingly such companies including mahindra electric kinetic green csl are placing women in leadership positions where else are our women entrepreneurial opportunities are plenty we have several companies women led startups that are supplying affordable portable chargers for evs in many of our states the delhi government has reserved 33% of its permits for women drivers in the state there's immense opportunity to feminize the entire ev ecosystem for instance pilot petroleum's all women fuel fuel station can be replicated across charging stations as well across the country clearly evs offer an opportunity to increase women in the economy and this is much needed for every 10 women in the working age group only 2 women work in india to increase women's participation in the workforce education matters but skill development matters even more studies find women who have attended skills training both formal and informal are more likely to be in the workforce regardless of their education levels the see the national skill development mission the asdc and their many efforts have noted how skilling can be a game changer for women of india skill development and just transition from the ice ecosystem to evs is absolutely essential as a country we can consider 2 approaches to facilitate the just transition from the ice sector to evs these can include targeting those skills that are transferable and those that are entirely new ice vehicles and evs have some overlapping components in terms of r and d manufacturing and service for instance in design vehicle system engineering which is simulation and modeling in ice would also be needed for ev designing like battery weight or positioning similarly in the software and domain as well machine learning for connectivity vehicle performance monitoring etcetera can be seen between both ice industry as well as the ev sector on the service front too there are a lot of overlaps again on the end of life management as well new as well as you know continuing skills pertaining to collection safe handling recycling can be a focus area and these are all avenues for us to explore how the the transition can be more just it is now time to scale the early victories we are achieving in the e mobility domain and the larger green sector compared to manufacturing of ice vehicles which relies heavily on heavy machinery ev companies are focused on electronics assembly software and design skill sets that are more widely available among women for every 10 new hires in the ev sector 6 tend to be women skilled in business modeling design redevelopment e mobility and renewable energy management going forward what should india do incentivize killing of women particularly in stem fields and like arindam sir mentioned earlier beyond stem as well foster academia and industry relations to create more courses on evs incentivize oems including start ups striving for gender parity in jobs through tax rebates incentivize hiring of women across the ev value chain this will go a long way in ensuring their integration into the labor force provide accelerator support and credit channels for women led ev entrepreneurial opportunity recognition of such opportunities under dedicated msme schemes could provide women with the much needed financial support and incentive in taking up roles in the ev revolution of the country learning from other models like the dual system for training initiative in haryana we could also look at replicating this within the ecosystem the effort to create a world class killing program needs to start from the grassroots india can take inspiration from plumbing institutes in odisha and beyond and replicate that within the ev's ecosystem overall of course india can transform itself to be a powerhouse of ev skills and there is a great case to be made for feminizing this transition from day 1 thank you so much",

        "content": "may i request mister to please give the welcome address for today's inauguration good morning everyone honorable minister nathan garkhir members of the dais and the respected audience i mean i think everybody starts on a welcome address saying it's indeed a pleasure but if i could just tell you how it is feeling for me having been part of this journey for the last 2 to 3 years that it is indeed an enormous pleasure for me to be standing here as we inaugurate the dg elv at the hands of the honorable minister for us at neml where we were known to be a market platform for all types of commodities mainly agriculture the journey into the esg space started 5 years ago we started with some platforms in the state of gujarat we migrated there thereafter into platforms on the epr space but again the right full boost for our efforts came in 2021 when the elv policy was actually and and i think you know we know from the interactions we have had with the ministry of road transport that it was probably crafted by honorable minister in terms of almost every nuances that are there including making sure that almost at the last minute he increased the coverage so that it's now become a very very huge sort of coverage in terms of the vehicles that are covered under this policy for us the last 2 years has been therefore a very good journey i would want to tell anybody who sometimes says oh sarkar i would say we've been so happy working with the ministry of road transport that i hope we can write a paper someday saying how is actually a pleasure for your guidance and for the way you've been driving the ministry of road transport again a big thank you and i think the culmination of all this has been that we at nml chose to choose a partner mrai to us was the most natural partner in this journey and therefore",

        "name": "Plenary Session \uff5c Can the EV Sector be India\u2019s Next Growth Engine\uff1f",
        "content": "so good afternoon everyone and thank you for being here today we're going to discuss the question i don't think it's a question anymore but still can india can the ev sector be india's next growth engine is there anyone in this panel who disagrees that evs will not be india's next growth engine no no i'm sorry good so i think we all agree that evs are going to be india's next growth engine india is now the world's 3rd largest automotive market although not the world's 3rd largest ev market yet so you know we'll get there china for example last year 25% of all all cars sold in china were electric right europe has announced a phase out of electric or or petrol and diesel vehicles us in its new regulations they've not said it so but it means that about 60% of all cars sold in the us will be elected by 2052 so the world is moving ahead and we will move ahead as well that's a given that we create immense opportunities 1,000,000,000,000 of dollars are being invested across the world on batteries evs and this ecosystem we need to develop this ecosystem we have very capable people here who are playing that role expertise and the best practices from around the world and from within india to be able to do that so with that you know let me stop and we keep this discussion on this whole panel very conversational so we're talking to each other making it interesting for each other and in the process making it interesting for the audience here today so the first question and maybe if i can start with you we need to scale up manufacturing right we're doing well in the small form factor the big you know singular we need it for that larger form factor as well 3 wheelers so that is an important sector of the market we have 35 players or so i guess who are investing in this space manufacturing in this space and as against say 4 or 5 people doing it traditionally right so the number of people or the number of investors is not an issue the issue is how do we scale this up how do we make this high quality and how do we make make it for the world and not just for india so you're doing some great work in this field tell us what are the key points and know keep it short what are the key points what needs to happen where are we headed what's the vision how can india become a global leader at least in this space and you would have said that you sure first of all thank you very much you know great work by icad department of energy i see what you and your teams are doing just me look you know voice and has continually been part we're gonna be the largest 3rd largest economy in the world we've got the largest population in the world we've got largest you know youngest population in the world we have got the most you know i keep talking about this we've got nadi shafi this is one of the strongest part of our country which we need to you know harness even better ev people say ev is the future i say ev is the present you know and it's not just ev we are working on hydrogen technology hopefully very shortly i'm gonna be able to show you you know the trucks on hydrogen we are working on but a 3 wheeler with 400 kilometers on a single charge right so but i think india is in a space you know you know i have you know you know we we have a very significant you know assets on the ground on automotive parts there's a huge there's a $500,000,000,000 business on automotive parts that india can be part of i think one thing i was gonna say i think the days where we are all gonna depend on the government to do something for us i think anybody who's building a business model with you know a handout from the government is so all of us you know i think i welcome people that business of this country in terms of electrification is fantastic the demand i mean you know 50 plus percent of 3 wheelers are electric you know in 5 years 70% of 2 wheelers or 3 wheelers are electric i'm hoping trucks which we are working on between 1 ton to you know 10 ton or 15 ton trucks there's a huge amount of movement towards that logistics coming every state you know the central government prime minister modi is talking about saudi revolution transport ministers building all of these beautiful highways so i think the future is absolutely fantastic we need and you know what 31 of the most polluted cities in the world in our country so we if we care about all these young men and women that are sitting out there right you know i'm saying you're very young yourself so i should say just out there just me the point is that you know we all have to do one thing we have to work you know i'm i'm into fitness and you know you know in a in a marathon the canadians run the first 20 kilometers with each other and then the 6 kilometers you know can be run to win we don't even have 500 meters we've all got to work together this is an alliance based see the incumbents are gonna be there but to be honest you know this is a play a fair playing ground for everyone so whether you know it is is you know the young lady sitting there with ebay you know whether it is always sam or it's biagio etcetera we all have an ally you know we've got to build the ecosystem not just evs or hydrogen but we've gotta build charging infrastructure battery motors and i think working together building together i would clearly clearly say india is poised to play a significant role i i speak you know quite regularly on this on this circuit you know the europeans and americans they still don't understand us i think an opportunity we're making india for the world and and again i'm not political i'm not representing anybody but i think before local for vocal became all of this normal there has been a lot of companies that are working together on the front lines and you know to build an ecosystem and i can clearly say and some of the big comments they they probably don't like me anyway because i'm a i'm a real disruptor you know but the key point is this is gonna be a mixture of law people thank you so like osf that learning evh as well is a is a ev first oem disrupting the space has seen the potential understands you know the opportunity that's out there tell us you know what how you're looking at this you know how are you kind of investing in manufacturing and what does that mean for the country in large and and you know we have a lot of young people here who are you know looking for opportunities i'm assuming in this space and you know what kind of opportunities are coming up and how big is that opportunity great thanks it's great so market that we are looking at along with india the emerging market and as most of us will agree it's the thing here that there needs to be some kind of collaboration between we don't get the kind of incentive because there i would disagree a little bit with mister naran we do need the government's support in terms of okay got it so there has to be a focus on modular factories smaller factories which can manufacture fast and deliver to the customers from the basis itself just 3 to 4 hours a day outside the city limits where the customer can come and take the the delivery of the vehicle and circular manufacturing this is something that all entities across india need to focus on because at the end of the day there are limited resources and we need to reduce our dependency on imports and we need to make sure that everything is made new house made in india and the last point and the 2 3rd most important point is skill there are a lot of young folks in this room we need more and more engineers we need more and more people getting skilled irrespective of the gender and i'm all for transgenders and other genders getting in this they're not getting jobs so we need more and more people getting skilled in institution technical institutions existing institutions will have courses on evs big applause for the government iits were doing their bit but we need more and more engineering schools and colleges to include tvs as a basic or alternate document other forms of use as part of the course yeah no i've been and and that scaling is a key key topic i've been and we've been having these discussions do this at the state level that you know see you miss cherry roundtables that we organize but you know all the business leaders whether it's you know the tatas the mahindra the bharat forges everyone is saying we need skills specific to the ev sector so the powertrain you know in the electrical engineers we need to know these courses selling skills in this sector are extremely sought sought after lot of investment is happening people are struggling to find the right people to fill the positions to be able to ramp up as quickly as they need to with that i'll hand over to you ayushi i know that of course moving is the running fleet and you know we talk a little bit about the question of whether what you are running is viable today or not and that's what our focus has been over the last few months and on ground how do we build that user experience from a driver perspective from a personal user perspective how do we have maintenance in place how do we make the driver feel safe and how about driving an ev and how does he or she think that the vehicle they're driving is reliable of course we are working with evh and osm and other oems and they are giving amazing vehicles but on ground the reality is the driver still thinks and compares that hey do i actually invest 1 lakh more in a 3 year i'm talking about a 3 year now do i invest in this i know you bought acha vehicle it will give me all the money and increase my livelihood income by about 25 to 30% and moving for example is going to give me the demand everything is in place but that doubt is still there so a skill building from a maintenance perspective is required also accessible and reliable charging infrastructure i would say is very important that comes under maintenance and accessibility and safety right now most of the infrastructure being built in india is focused on personal vehicles we need to start looking to commercial infrastructure as well and that to it be affordable they can't have them drivers pay 20 to 25 rupees per unit when it comes to them working on it i'd also like to talk about women so i myself and a few others in the organization took up an in-depth in-depth study on why women especially in south india where they are more open to working and driving why were they not joining us or leaving us after a few months we realize it comes down to small things at the workplace level of course safety is one thing but even the largest of organizations your largest companies actually don't have toilets in place at their warehouses women where whether whether there are women guards or even if there's a female in the larger warehouse women drivers are ready to work there for longer periods in general so just figuring that out is also important from a safety and diversity perspective there's an organization called mowo m o w o in hyderabad who is upscaling ev drivers and specifically women to drive evs and working with oems on the same and lastly i will just wanna talk about when it comes to infrastructure in general and having looking into localizing energy infrastructure as well to have that reliability then there isn't reliable safe infrastructure drivers are not going to buy evs at mass yep and picking up on charging infrastructure there we of course need to build massive you know charging public charging infrastructure of course you know everyone can install chargers when they stay on work but we also need to build massive public infrastructure that needs to power all of these vehicles so if i can come to you ahmed you know how do we invest in this infrastructure as a country who invests in this infrastructure and you know how do we take it 100 x absolutely i think that's a lot of it i think charging infrastructure to me would probably the most important aspect when you're looking at scaling up to your devices and i think the charging infrastructure story we'll have to break it into 2 parts one is for the private vehicles and the other is for the commercial vehicle now for the private vehicle category the bulk of the charging will have a new platform now and while it's easy to say it will happen but it's very very difficult i'm buying delhi i live in gurgaon i have electric car i've been running with colluding with my rwa for 9 months to give me a 15 ampere socket at my pocket so much so that one of my friends has draw dropped a wire from 22nd road to charge a car on the ground is that what we want absolutely so i think we also have to create some regulation free jail build bylaws which mandate these housing societies to provide charging at 1 and that's one big important piece but i think we also need to figure a way out how do we create public charging infrastructure because there will be times when we will do some random trips some long journeys some outstation travel and that's where you can't rely on this vehicle so you need to have public journey and one of the feedback that i often keep hearing about charging usage is only 4 5% it would be 4 5% right now but as the numbers increase these percentages will go up but the other important thing is what is price that is coming out at this charging location if you look at public charging fast charging prices vary anywhere between 20 rupees a unit to 30 rupees a unit as i guess 5 or 6 rupees that we'll charge issue is completely aoi you can't charge at 30 rupees a unit and say my business is profitable so i think we have to look back and see why are we promoting it that to me is a fundamental reason why and there are many reasons why 1 as you said mentioned in your opening statement even with india's existing grid which is predominantly coal electric vehicles are cleaner the car is cleaner anywhere between 9 20% and a 2 wheeler is greater anywhere between 45 to 55% in terms of life situation but in 2030 when the prime minister said 50% of the energy will come from renewable sources non fossil fuel sources we will be only cleaner so with electric mobility we have a path to clean transport so that's one 2nd we also have to look at public health we did a research and we found that india loses roughly around 75,000 lives every year these are premature deaths that are directly attributed to vehicular exhaust so once you remove that vehicular exhaust which electric vehicles do you are saving 74 75,000 lifetime daily and 3rd which is very important previously the session was on so a country which imports 80 how can you be self reliant when you are running your vehicles on a positive in this business so i think when you bring these things together 0 emission vehicle is gonna be a forward many cases in most cases it will be battery left hand in some cases it will be harder and full sir but these are all deviance of innovative vehicles innovation vehicle and that's where we need to move forward what do we want from our cities cleaner safer cost competitive and that's why we need to push think it's quite stupid as well they're not able to figure that out but that's the that's the problem right that we are not moving fast enough as a society in terms of making rules and you know what we need to do as fast as this transition is going to happen right we are still at early stages this transition and if we can gather you know the the the public momentum to solve some of these very menial issues i would say then you know what hope do we have to to solve for the biggest this one yeah a simple geo order yeah from haryana government saying that group housing societies will give a 15 npl npl we'll solve this problem yeah so let's solve it move yeah that's the yeah yeah so i think i think it's up to us up to us you know as society to just solve these problems and you know know do all of those things let's just come together i think we have you know what 50 60 people in this room and if they can all talk to say 5 or 6 people about this issue i think there'll be enough momentum to solve it right in in in just just wanna add another note so one thing is i think we have moved a long way i'll i'll be i'll be honest and if we you know been in this journey now for 8 9 years our movies for somebody that we've seen a lot of players come we've seen a lot of players go also and now we've been sitting on that you know fishing out there and waiting this is this is a marathon this is not a sprint and i think please understand you know there's not a quick rich get skilled this is about and i know you know i was the executive manager because i was i was invested in all of this but the point is clearly what moving you know what you talked about in terms of women i'm happy to line forces with you any day i'll give you vehicles if we get women so i'm happy to do this but what i am saying is just look back and look at the speed this is absolutely you know to turn around and make a difference the amount of green plates i i like travel to work listen go to africa go to i mean you know i i spent a lot of my old history in the hindu thailand so there's a lot of work that is being done i know but this is a very big country it's 1,400,000,000 plus it takes time they just make you feel good i'm sorry i'm very passionate about this on a per capita basis they're ahead of us but on a tv adoption basis we are ahead of them right similarly for you lots of these countries so i i think we're doing a great job we just need to keep up the momentum and there's no reason why india can't be you know a leader in this case and you know make sure that our companies and our startups and our you know businesses are able to capture this market in other parts of the world shifting gears a little bit and coming to you sudip we need to build supply chains you know we have a strong automotive industry we have auto components industry some of these things are changing you know we need batteries we need you know critical raw materials we need the charging and you know everything that goes with you know moving from a nice base platform to electric platform how should a country like india focus on on the aspect of building these supply chains and you know what needs to happen for for us to assess as well alright of one of the one of the biggest challenges that we've had on the supply chain is the is the kind of job in the automotive industry is is going to need to be out of the outskirts there's another there's another paper that steps up every we're trying to build towards sorry we're trying to build momentum towards the transition but we really don't have the people to kind of so unless we are unless we are building government policies getting in academia and getting in the oems to kind of work you know do you have any insights on how that played out and you know i think in in in that sense where do we realize in that and if i can come to you next suresh you represent you know gsf which is the german thank you jasmeet yes being with jaz there are many activities there are many projects in the portfolio we are looking into for specifically to sustainable of the sustainable of our mobility as well as for example i start with if you would mention about the ceo to project we had the ceo to project a pilot program to bhubaneswar and therefore the bhubaneswar we call these 50 electric motors we give these are being specifically driven by women and transgenders by the women as well so 33% participation we are trying to have this under all these and as well there are different other projects for example are trying to have this market assessment for the post subsidy policy era for this we are trying to have different stakeholder consultations with different oems with the the gateway and all different stakeholders who understand what what how the policy decision should look like who's this subject for it because i think what i heard is and we're doing it there's specific one project which we're already focused on e mobility we are trying to establish the center of excellence in india see we we are increasing the minus on lithium ion as in the semiconductors which which is very i mean predominantly can be different problems for this type of geopolitical research so we need to evaluate those things as well sure so if i i can come back to you there i think how i understand it and you can correct me if i'm wrong the fleet segment where you know your products go is the first one world in a sense right and there are certain set of economics which say that for example and how how are more people not buying for example and how how are you you know developing first of all you know i wanna add one thing on on the you know on the skill set just just to give you the idea we will voice them as aligned forces iit madras iit delhi iit roper vit many many women's colleges we will open up center of excellence it's over 30 over 30 universities i know i go in my office i was there i usually have an end till midnight to 1 am i've got 20 28 days of this month are gone be it this financial year every day is a countdown so we will open up to massive alliances with multiple universities across this country to help him with his skill okay i keep telling you i'm not waiting for anybody i'm gonna walk alone if i have to right and this the only way this is gonna be done and i'm hoping i mean you and moving and at eveage everybody is gonna walk and i'm thinking really if we're gonna win this is these people out there especially the young men and women sitting in the back they're the one who's gonna lead coming back to you and japan i don't think anything i produce is sold honestly how many of you we we came out a new product called stream and stream city people ask me for 20 i give 2 right so there is no shortage of demand in this country go outside and see the number of 3 wheeler electric you know i spend bada make times at night when i'm not dressed like this and i'm wearing a kurta pajama and i go to your hub and i wanna talk to the drivers i wanna speak with them maybe i wanna have a tea or maybe i wanna have a drink don't don't mind me in the wrong way right i you know and but but but you know what i mean i'm telling you reality right so when we are there there is no shortage of demand in this country on the trucks absolutely the one has got a very significant demand i think you know that pricing in there madam maybe you you you like is about like or don't like is about 10 to 11 likes and that's the number maybe a bit lower right so we're working on fixed fast charging swap models i think technology will come back plays a major major role so so what at osm fast charging fixed fixed batteries are expensive can i come back with a solution of fast charging can i come back on a solution on swap where the battery cost goes down 30% safety first right and the and the talk in the 3 and the 2 there's no discussion on the tcu model we're in there i mean if moving is doing it and multiple other players are doing it and if you see the vehicles even forget about delhi bangalore mumbai i'm working on tier 2 3 4 cities also ahmedabad you know beyond on on the 4th time in chidwarra i didn't even know which chidwarra before my team told me i have to go there right so what i'm saying is that technology is playing a major role we've come up with a powertrain which beats every vehicle on the ground which is 40% cheaper so as technology come out as you know we get new you know everybody 5 years ago just me who was talking especially the big boys and girls they weren't talking about evie whatever everybody is in this game which is okay so at the end of the day i don't wanna talk about osm i wanna talk about it if somebody else builds a better product than me then you know who wins moving wins and if moving wins who win it's these consumers that are winning and at the end of the decade if we really want if we really want this country to move forward and you you talked about 75 somebody talked about 75,000 people it's not 75 world of your kids if they've got asthma there might not be a fatality speech is another thing that slips to the front line so i've started speaking in that a little bit but the point is the kids and the future kids do we wanna leave them even if they don't have fatalities but are they having asthma and the damage to that the future society we're talking of becoming a 3rd largest economy in the world what i don't want is a few people in mumbai and a few people in gujarat having that 9 or 10,000,000,000,000 maybe having 9.5 trillion and all of us sitting down here we need to lift this hope and absolutely women need to be 48% of this country is women and i'll be honest with you in my factories i have our factories all across this country not in osm also the productivity of women is much much better because the boys are always focusing on something else always in the wrong things right so the point is the technology the economy the the the the selling of i don't need to sell anything i don't need to sell hydrogen it is already proven safety and better products are important osm is gonna be part of it but i'm gonna say let's build we are at 500 meters don't worry about what we said diageo mahindra tara evange everybody let's just put vehicles and let's build the ecosystem are you saying supply is a constraint not demand absolutely i i mean honestly my product supply chain right is it look it is there is no shortage but good products safe products i see moving you know they gave us feedback we worked with them we continually work on improving our product drivers educate there has to be an education of the drivers we need to be part of the ecosystem where you know opponents and this has to take place no great so and you can go ahead and then you you complete that laugh the role and you know looking at it also from a country perspective right how do we maintain our position as the world's from a manufacturing standpoint how do we maintain that given that you know europe is going to ban evs so you know a lot of investments are good act and in the europe because of the regulations there you know how are we getting that money to i think we'll open up the floor and i want to hear from you know all of you what your questions and are to the panel and we'll spend about you know say 5 minutes or so taking questions and then we'll close the session let's see how many questions we have if you can be quick you know i think we'll appreciate it yes thank you for this session so my question is to anybody who would like to answer how sustainable you know we are manufacturing these evs because i think most of them if you're saying we are not yeah so i think theoretically it is your hand if any i mean if you look at examples coming from europe and other 97 98% materials are being recycled and in some places i have seen that the recycled materials they are saying are if not more the these materials in the natural places so right now the recycling is not happening because there's not enough critical volume but once the volume comes up you will see recycling happening and i think this is very important for us because what we couldn't do with lead acid batteries i think we should do it with the lithium ion battery so cycling circularity of batteries and that ecosystem is very important it is happening in the west there is no reason why it can't happen but i think it will take some time before we see it because when we get enough volumes particular volumes then we will see recycling happening as well in fact last time also i had this question with deo doctor deo sir and he assured that definitely we'll go in the direction that the major role in the growth of this ev in this country is the services which is going to play services means we are focusing more towards the engineers the top level brain in this country work with the iits and its and all but down the line the work is done by the technicians the i mean service people who are having less knowledge of the schools and colleges but they are very much efficient in their work so towards the training to boost people what means initiative has been taken by the companies or the governments because i'm in that domain and i'm in training and services so i'd like to have some answer in that very very very valid point you know i i have i was just as very valid when i was sitting day before yesterday with my team to the evening and we talked about what we're gonna do is we are gonna at every we have about a 175 touch points right now i'll tell you what we are gonna do and i think the work needs to be aligned with everybody we've got a 175 touch points across this country which will go about 300 by the end of this year every one of those touch points we are talking to the to the dealers and saying let's open up training sessions where osm personnel will go and teach on you know on a saturday or a sunday we'll organize some food and some things and all of the local drive you know you know mechanics all of that you know spool and if you're an ice agent in in a 1 kilometer you've got 20 30 people sitting and they fix it let's work on putting those people into training 1 you'll give them a livelihood number 2 they know the areas and the business very well number 2 technical schools you know we all just need to focus on anybody doesn't need to be a phd or a or a master's or a bachelor the technical skills in europe and in america especially in deutschland right the technical skills you know are so focused there are such high paying jobs in today even in india if you're a if you're a good plumber or if you're a good mechanic or if you're a good driver i mean i think drivers should be paid more money the part of this is we are paying them nothing you're not paying you're not you're not paying them nothing because i'll be honest the ecommerce do anything you know they all talk about green energy stability i'm sorry i'm you know there's some of my customers too so i'm being very very direct but i know your problems because i understand those so so it will take time but i think we at rosesem are gonna work i'm happy to align with moving and other players that that want to train people i will say we are happy to have training sessions even at our factories you know we are happy to have an alliance with people that are willing to focus on this space and give input from our head of production head of quality you know and and many many others coming into this i mean i've noticed in my organization i've seen many people that started with nothing and are re leading up the organization as we open up factories here and globally so it's something that absolutely is on my radar and we all need to work on this so at moving what is happening more organically i'll add to that from that perspective as well as there's an organization in chennai i'm forgetting their name they are a driver train in center and i believe recently they trained 1,000 technicians for if i'm remembering for a large oem i won't say the name because i'm not sure of that oem oem for their electric buses so there are organizations on ground who are training and upskilling existing existing technicians at moving we're also making sure that with now with 2 years of experience on ground how do we say that once suppose a vehicle breaks down it's not just we issue a battery that's what everyone is a battery could have it's not that sometimes it's as small as brake pad issues some small error just like an ice vehicle so as more knowledge is coming into the ecosystem upskilling is happening organically as well as there are institutions who are training technicians on ramps it's it's an ongoing process and it's very active any other questions in the audience yeah hi this is for the oems on the stage as you see observe like the battery prices for the first time in the last decade increased last year i think it's around $150 per kilowatt hour and currently we are hugely dependent on other countries and some of the countries are very sensitive in terms of external relations also as an oems how confident are you and how do you think we are ready for another supply chain crisis like with respect to battery raw materials procurement like there is a lot of interest on the western come markets so what do you think oems can do better and where do you think government can help the oems in terms of building those relations with those mining companies abroad thank you so let me try and answer that a little bit of course there are there are a lot of critical raw materials and critical raw materials are going to be important we can't deny it you know we need a good build capacity in that area but even so i think building those supply chains and building those relationships is really important the government has you know brought together some of the public sector companies to come together and you know scout for these global resources and you know make long term agreements for their sourcing businesses i don't know of any large oem who's not working on evs and they're not working on a strategy to source raw materials for you know most oems they will focus on switching the batteries and the country and it makes sense and it has happened in other parts of the world as well for oems to form a consortium to you know showcase demand and you know collate their aggregate their demand and do some of these large deals on sourcing so that's the kind of model being followed globally and you know markets will you know play a role but as you said there are geopolitical sensitivities there's a geopolitical decoupling happening between the us and china which has huge ramifications on every sector right and on the battery question we are gonna announce a major deal in a very near future where cells are not coming from china it's coming from the united states and we'll be sending we're setting battery pack plant and we can you'll hear that in the news very soon but coming back akibab basically products id 67 effect electrical vehicle understanding drivers process important here charging i'm charging we'll be announcing next week or next 7 days with a very large oil company charging infrastructure across this country companies like nuvein companies like image some of the speakers will be around so feel free to you know ask questions as we go out but you're closing remarks and then we will take i think it was just a 30 seconds to answer your battery packs will have higher capacity and more active problem you keep up up you have to test",

        "content": "morning steve thank you akram thank you for inviting me and it's always a pleasure to be here at icad you know these design and engineering centers of excellence in the country wherever you go in terms of aria grc army tracks i think always can rekindles the whole you know engineering skill building initiatives that we keep talking about and i think some of these facilities could actually become the biggest temples of skill education in this country which is very important continuing from where my friend tapal had just written about dli you know if we have to do a dli we need a lot of manpower and design you know right from the early days engineering initiative when when i was in maruti you know a lot of our engineering started only from being able to read engineering drawing rather than create an engineering drawing and we've come a long distance but we still have another long distance to go in terms of having designs done not only for the indian market but the global markets as well skilling plays a very important role and somehow in this country skilling gets associated only with blue colored workers true yes it is required at the blue colored worker level but whether it's a blue or a gray or a white or whatever it is you need skilling and i think 2 great examples of 2 competing industries i would say to automobile in terms of talent acquisition at least in this country which is the it and the telecom sector and i think the engagement of these industries with academic institutions learning spaces have been tremendous and the results are for us to see in terms of the growth that these industries have made and are continuing to attract young talent much more than some of the other industries i think automobile personally because i'm fairly always been very passionate about automobiles so coming from me i mean one can always say you know a biased view but i think it's the most global industry that we have in india because all the global brands are here what we do here in india is all of global standards whatever we do some of the things we don't do so we we can't talk about it but whatever we do especially if i talk about manufacturing i think we we manufacture to the global standards our exports is a testimony to that context so if we decide to do the full range of services for this country i think it can be done but coming back to specifically to evs i think it gives us a new opportunity you know i i see it and i keep telling this that for the it industry the y two k happened as a new problem to be solved for the world and it industry in india boom we have an ev problem on a cleaner i would i would rather expand it to a cleaner energy solution for mobility problem that we need to solve today ev battery electric vehicle happens to be one of the solutions that we are working here today but india has a moment of y two k for the automobile industry and for that we need of youngsters coming into this industry and being excited about this industry and opportunities like this where we can send a message across to the youngster that this is an industry of the future this is a place technology of the future and i think if you decide to get yourself skilled in that area and continue skilling and reskilling and upskilling yourself in that area one can actually look forward to a great professional journey that one can do better quickly at the end i would wanna highlight a few of our initiatives at asdc we of course have almost about 12 specific curriculum on electric vehicles that we have developed which we are offering with partnership of various training centers training locations colleges polytechniques itis we need greater reduction of that in terms of bringing fresh skilled manpower into the system and we would need a very very wholehearted participation of all the major stakeholders industry government both at the central level as well as at the state level and that has been our endeavor to engage in conversations with the reporters the other big area that we see is in terms of rescaling and upscaling of existing manpower especially when we talk about service vehicle service related manpower in the ev sector especially in the 2 and the 3 wheeler segment where we have a significant population already and a lot of people have no clue as to how and where they could go should they have a problem with their vehicle or should they have a challenge of operating the vehicle not because of any problem the vehicle but because they are not aware of how this vehicle works okay so there is a significant work to be done we are already engaging through corporate partnerships under csr through government partnerships through government skilling programs where we are trying to bring this upskilling program down to the ground mechanics especially in the 2 and 3 miller segment to start with lastly and which is most important being the world aid for safety and health i think ev brings in another dimension of safety into our whole automobile industry so far i think 2 large safety issues that we've been trying to grapple with has been industrial safety and road safety and i think we have a big chunk now sitting in in terms of ev usage safety or ev maintenance safety while we are maintaining these vehicles or while we are using these and i would want to end with a personal experience of last summer i called in for a electric vehicle cab i live in delhi we get the services of one of the major players the vehicle came to my home at 3 o'clock in the afternoon it was this hot sunday afternoon in the month of june or july last year and when i got into the vehicle the vehicle refused to start so the driver said it's up we got down from the vehicle and he started opening the bonnet with a bottle of water and i had to literally run after him and i said was he electric vehicle don't put water because they've been used to putting water into the radiator when the vehicle heats up and it refuses to start so it needs to go down to that level of safety and electric vehicle safety when we talk about buses when we talk about public trans which carries passenger which carries goods last mile delivery lot of adoption is happening we need to be clear about the safety issues there and we are doing some programs thanks to mhi and giz our partners on electric bus safety that we are we have already launched across multiple cities and we look forward to scale this up as we as we go forward in partnership with other oems and everyone else thank you very much for inviting me here today thank you",

        "content": "inspiration 5 trillion economy trend he thinks about 10,000,000,000,000 economy simple simplicity i'll never call him as a politician he's a social worker he works for social responsibility social consciousness and social sensitivity he's a youth icon of india biggest believer of karma he's the biggest performer now may i request mister nathan to please come forward and deliver his speech thank you may i request you to the launch of the glv okay if you can thank you mister prashant banerjee ed siam mister sanjay mehta president material recycling association of india mister prashant panjerg board member mehta material circular markets mister nitin chirikara coo mmcm distinguished dignitaries officials guests ladies and gentlemen it is really a pleasure for me by exactly thinking on futuristic development the way in which you are taking initiative it is really very remarkable and i'm giving special thanks to all of you for taking this initiative now we had taken charge as a minister in 2014 the atoll industry number was 7 in the world manufacturing sector and now just 2 3 months before we have just surpassed japan and our number is 3rd now the first is china 2nd usa and 3rd is india the 3rd largest vehicle market in the world is now we can take it india is with a pride that we are number 3rd by taking initiative in the particularly in the scrapping policy alternative fuel biofuel because of this global biofuel alliance and lot of things and the way in which all the reputed and well reputed brands which are available in the world they are present in india and what type of order they are getting for their exports it is really a great history in the development of our country 5 days before i got a opportunity to visit in bangalore for construction equipment manufacturing examination there exhibition there now in the construction equipment our turnover is 1 lakh crore and 10 days before in my home i got about to launch jcb on cng the md was telling me that 140 countries we have export for jcb from india now in the 2 wheeler also the bajaj tbs and hero they have already export of their 50% of the production now even lot of companies for tractor for buses for trucks they are doing also good export by using different type of technology particularly in the alternative fuel and biofuel are just coming through hydrogen car here so now the futuristic development in the automobile sector is very important now in the country in the alternative fuel we are lot of good experiment and the technology is already proven first of all the pollution is a big concern the ethics economy ecology and environment these are the important pillars of our society and ecology and environment is very important particularly in delhi we are facing the problem because of air pollution and 40% of the air pollution is because of the transport sector so today it is the time that we have to protect our ecology and environment and as far as economy is concerned our automobile sector is very important the present size of the automobile sector is 12.5 lakh crore growth rate of vehicle is coming to 10% and employment from the sector is 4 0.50 lakh crore in the country and this is the sector which is giving maximum tax as a part of gst to the state and central government so in our development the sector is very important and even in the export also this sector is leading the transport sector is responsible for 40 percent emission of co2 85 percent of fossil fuel it is dependent and it is import of 16 lakh crore i am estimating that the way in which the automobile sector is developing within 5 years our import will be 24 lakh crores so it can be a big challenge for our economy and we need to find out the solution for that so now the with the cooperation of all of you our government with the hands of prime minister mister modi ji we launched the scrapping policy it is very useful win win situation for every stakeholder now the pollution from 1 old truck is equivalent to pollution caused by 15 new trucks in india you just understand the cost economics is there i remember when i got opportunity to construct mumbai pune expressway in maharashtra and warli bandra ceiling project and 55 flowers at that time there was a big criticism that we are taking toll so at that time coming from pune to mumbai it takes 9 to 10 hours now it is 2 hours so 8 hours saving for time and the fuel is very important so presently by using the new technology we can save a lot of things as far as the cost of fuel is concerned so i feel that the scrapping policy is a is a win win position for all stake government has decided to end of life vehicle in government is 3 crores state and central government just before coming to this program rajasthan chief minister was in my house and we had discussion deputy chief minister was also there so i suggest then that you can scrap your vehicle and take electric vehicle or alternative fuel and by which government will give you some assistance for that there is a policy so today government has already started we are requesting centimeters for many days that for business point of view it is very useful for them by scrapping off old vehicle the sale is going to increase by 16% where they will they will be beneficial so i'm requesting then the the person who got they get the scrapping certificate if you can offer them some discount about purchasing of new vehicle then it will be a win situation for all we are waiting for the reply so there is also a a good potential everyone is benefited manufacturers government state government central government and persons who are taking new vehicles all are being benefited from that the government owned vehicles aged over 15 years that is approximately 3 lakhs vehicles or 2.8 lakhs in central government available operational register scrapping centers forty two numbers are only there and now the scrapping centers approved 85 numbers and we actually the way in which our atover sector is developing i feel that we need 1,000 scrapping centers in the country and at least 400 fitness centers now the i already request all manufacturers tata has taken initiative they have started some scrapping centers lot of companies are coming because in indian situation i'm not the expert but aluminum it is import is there copper import is there steel also there is import and even for rubber and plastic also the input is there so by using this scrapping material i feel that we can reduce the cost of components where we can reduce the cost of the vehicle so it is also 10 to 12% boost in sales gs to revenue of government will be increased and pollution will be reduced by 20 to 25 25% india's scrapping hub in south asia region particularly from bangladesh bhutan myanmar maldives nepal and sri lanka we can get the scrapping material now i am always talking to the people about 2 important philosophies one is conversion of knowledge into wealth the innovation entrepreneurship science technology research skill and successful practices we name it as knowledge and conversion of knowledge into wealth is the future and the second important thing is conversion of waste into wealth that is very important now in delhi u r 2 and the delhi ring road we have already used 20 5 lakh ton of municipal garbage in delhi mumbai express i also use in ahmedabad dholero there also we use 25 lakh ton of municipal waste there now by segregating municipal waste we'll get plastic rubber then metals glass and metal and glass again we can make the recycling of that and getting good value addition so my suggestion is the circulation economy is very important for example i'll give you the example the india needs 80 lakh ton of bitumen out of which our refinery capacity is only 50 lakh turn so 30 lakh turn is import so now i requested just 1 year before to our level minister for environment that give the permission for import of used tire waste tire and where we can make this rubberized powder we can add 15% in bitumen and 7% plastic in bitumen by which we can reduce the cost of bitumen and even the rubberized bitumen is supposed to be better quality so west to wealth is really a very very important philosophy for the country to create more jobs and at the same time the circulation economy is very important this circulation economy is going to create more jobs for the country and for our growth the role of circulation economy is very important and even for scrapping centers we can import the old vehicle from particularly bangladesh bhutan myanmar maldives nepal and sri lanka because they don't have the facility there are other important thing is the scrappy ecosystem in circular economy is very important recovering maximum value from the scrap or end of life vehicle that is waste to wealth so availability of low cost raw material like steel copper aluminum rubber and plastic you can make the recycling of it and we can dilute the 30% reduction in raw material cost and production cost of vehicle will be reduced and your profit will going to increase and we are expecting that because of scrapping the sale domestic sale will be increased by 16% thus semiconductor metals such as lithium and aluminium can be reused in automobile components and rare earth metal such as neodymium is used as an ndfe magnet in electric vehicles so that is also the use of it aluminum can be used in ev battery technologies such as already indian oil research laboratory fridhaba developed aluminum air technology and now this technology also available in usa now the problem in atwell industries the cost of lithium ion battery when we start electric vehicle it was $150 per kilowatt per hour now i just informed it that it is coming to $115 and i'm confident within a year or 2 year it will be equivalent coming $100 then it will be equivalent to petrol and diesel cost so electric is the future and now hydrogen electric people are changing i remember one of the giant manufacturing automobile i request him he's my good friend that you go for electric but he was telling me like government people we have a plan plan phase 1 phase 2 maybe you're going to hell you will remember me for the life now he many time anyway key my prediction was wrong and we never expect that that by such a speed the electric vehicle manufacturing will be increased and now the people who are taking initiative they are benefited so my suggestion is i feel that the new technology particularly the battery also there is a huge potential conversion of waste into wealth the rubber and all the things we are using the steel wires in tires are being used for steel fiber we have we have introduced this enforcement concrete it is a very interesting thing in the pier and metro the distance between the two pier is maximum 50 meter but upper hand beam if we can cast with the steel fiber then we can increase this length up to 120 meters so we can reduce the cost of bridges and metro by 30 to 40% so already we have started this and these wire steel fiber pieces can be used in enforcement concrete that can be also used of it the scrapping ecosystem will create 50,000 jobs and that is very important so i feel that the way in which you are now taking initiative today it is to be very useful i congratulate to metamaterial circular market launch of dglev that certificate of deposit trading platform is very important there is huge potential because we should always think about futuristic technology futuristic vision and futuristic planning and that is to be most important thing for our country we are the fastest growing economy in the world and the dream of prime minister to make indian economy in the world 3rd number so the automobile industry is really one of the important sector for that the ministry of road transport and highways authorized for that at the time of the policy we have taken a lot of decision we want to make it more liberal still there are problems it is a problem with the government people who are always working there i have changed their total policy but still there are some their smart impressions are there so you suggest us we will improve that then this is already integrated with wahan portal and database of nationwide registered scrapping centers is also with us platform helps end of life vehicles owners to quickly find the value of their cd and trade the availability of benefit linked to cd that is road tax concession also and waiver of registration fees on new vehicles transfer certificate gate generated instantly seamless fund transfer in bank account of of cd seller and from centimeters we are expecting that they will take some decision i'm requesting then that this decision is going to help only you for increasing your business for getting more business it is to be very much beneficial to you so we are expecting their decision so the authorized scrapping facilities is very important it will make the bridges the price cap and unorganized players offer higher prices end of life vehicles where we need to find out to make some discipline where if you can give them some attractive benefit and a authorized scrapping center is giving certificate and after that they will get the benefit then people will prefer to go through the platform and go through a recognized scrapping centers so there are some problems but we can resolve that i'm really happy that this sector is going to create a new economic transformation in the country and presently it is going to reduce our import create more jobs and getting government state government and good revenue and 100% going to reduce the pollution so this is everywhere a win win situation for all stakeholders so i'm really happy i'm giving my best wishes for you for taking this initiative and i'm confident that you will get good response from the market thank you very much namaskar",

        "content": "i would like to invite our next speakers on stage we will be discussing on india's present journey and future road map and for the same i would like to invite on stage the very first miss minu sargi chief strategy and operations asd council it was the next mister deepak jain regional head ev charging in from tata power shri praveen kumar sood chairman technical federation of electrical vehicle cb ramonson executive director emission control manufacturers association this is nehal gupta director amu easing ca dhruv agarwal chairman federation of ev association and to moderate this session i invite mister yashpal sutchar vice president corporate affairs ashok leyland be one of the area and i would like to check with each one of them while we discuss this issue okay so let's make it interactive so the people who was waiting till the last session find it work yeah so i hope there are other it's also available here so maybe starting from the extreme end if in 1 or 2 minutes you can talk about yourself and something on the topic hello i'm we are in the amrut kal 76 year and after 30 years of the 30 80 years of the independence we got one car from here that is a marty with with the most modern technology and then in 96 we got first a diesel car as a tata sumo in india but now we are coming to the giving revolution that is basically and now this is the second green revolution with the with this green the carbon emission so that and by 2,070 we are aiming for 0 emission and for that the ev will answer to play wrong though there will be many other thing there will be the bio cng which i am focusing and then the electric vehicles that we and then the hydrogen and most important thing is that the habit of the persons is to be changed because of this gene like about this electronic vehicles i can say the most important and most difficult thing is what is that is a battery manufacturing because in india we are only making a battery pack because we are not making a single failure for the this battery pack so unless we are in the big 20 we want to go in the electric vehicles first of all not only the gst on the battery but the there should be incentive on the bent battery manufacturing and the government should come out for the battery management without battery there cannot be this you can say revolution because i'm i mean this is only remission then first of all electricity to be provided and there should be proper investment in the electricity then there should be the proper investment in the bend battery manufacturing only then this paris convention on whatever the government is thinking 3rd reason why reducing only the 5% gst is temporary sir step is that we have to compete compete with all the manufacturer and the this gst like many other person this is a misnomer because the most of the capital is used in paying gst on the component the capital the the here the norms banking norms are there they can provide only 60 to 75% of the total working capital as a balance and we we are doing in in the gst regime we are paying gst in advance by on the purchasing of the component so the every if there is a shortage of the capital how there may be the quality electronic electric vehicles 3rd thing is for the low low speed ev second and this is scooter and all these things which is running only the up to 30 kilometer speed for this there should not be any requirement of the insurance there should not be any requirement of the licensing this will be termed as the e y scale only then they can survive otherwise there will be only the 4 of 5 big company so i will i will say this punch amrit which had been said in the this spanish convention that will be the glasgow summit for that we have to really work hard for making this profitable because and then there are only 10 core farmers in india it is in the economy okay so i'm gonna there are only 10 gold farmers and 5 golds are in the auto 5 golds persons are employed directly for core and one core this is other supporting industry five cores employment and the earning of these 5 cores are more than the all the farmers in india so this is a very big sector for gdp for the economy so i will tell you you can this will not be only for the saying that we are doing the policy thinking many other thing i am also in the government but i am in other field i am the is with the i am the chairman of the resource committee on animal welfare board of india i've been to the usa on the ministry of law also usa china vietnam thailand for meeting at that time the got the general admin and tariffs but now we want this renewable forces but we have to come really hard we have to make this now their persons are saying about the tractors that has been also been reduced by us only sorry ma'am go ahead at that time there was president of this electric vehicles association we were we have tried from the last 3 years for reducing this gst and you at at gurgaon we have conducted a seminar 5 years back with our tv channel and at that time they are making gst 60% on the electric vehicles more than 18 and 28% that's left by there and they are pressed to do the government but like many other thing if the capital will be blocked in the gst for the component then how the industry will survive only few players will survive if we really want electric vehicles we want to have the facility on the this on the ep manufacturing and electronic so money should be cheaper second thing material there is difficulty in the lithium iron and all other materials this is also problem 3rd is a skill manpower the concerns that everyone mentioned that sir just mentioned i think there's a great positive outlook there's a fantastic push from the government i think our current government is all about not pushing anything that is emitting carbons to the country and we have learned from our past mistakes and i think now we're rectifying that with ev it's just starting i know everyone has a lot of concerns about the financial viability or the gst part or the but it's just starting to get assembled so my request is to give it time and give your best to whatever you can to contribute to it thank you thank you yeah first of all thank you icat and the palm media to build this opportunity and i present ecma that is emission control manufacturers association so the emission control itself we are talking about the green ability mission now the i'll be mainly focusing on is ev which is representing i would say currently about 2% of the total volumes so out of 100 if i take it's only with this 2% today and by 2,030 we are aiming at about 50% and 2,070 we will be carbon neutral so a long long journey to go but is ebi the panacea for addressing or reaching i would say the green mobility solution is that the only solution that you will be achieving or the 98% today what we have the engines ic engines should we totally start ignoring it and totally focusing i was just a friend who just started talking all the conferences seminars not focusing on eb and we are sidelined more or less i see that it's not going to be there but i my suggestion or my submission to this group is i see engines is going to be there for some more time and we need to focus on that and there are lot of solutions for achieving those kind of you know our mission i would say green mobility mission i see engines can definitely through maybe alternate fuels like we have talked about hydrogen mission or scng there are a lot of option start discussing further so that options are still alive we should we should not lose focus on ic engines emission reduction to that i mean i'll be contributing more on that side already hi friends this is deepak jain i'm part of tata power ev charging team so in tata we are contributing in green mobility our group has a initiative by creating like tata motors is creating ev vehicles in tata power we are creating ev charging system so as a largest cpu we are a big amount of breadth of the country we have around 3,000 charging stations and we have from kashmir to ganap mariam and silchar to surat by traveling ev by using ev charging stations of tata power so we are actively working on this and government is everybody is saying government is supporting very much like in state government central government policies are there i think still we have some room to have some improvement on the discom parts the upstream infra and other parts which you will discuss later thank you good afternoon my name is praveen kumar sood i'm here as a national technical head of federation of electric vehicles manufacturing association and to talk about my background i have the industrial training partner and master trainer and subject specialist for electronic sector skill council of india for 4 subjects led lighting technologies solar photovoltaics batteries energy storage and electric verticals and having been associated with electronics industry when i was just 20 years old with the largest electronics published journal in india which is called electronics for you you can check up the issues from 1975 to 9 74 and one of the beneficiaries of my writing is sitting right here in front of us mister rajiv gulati is retired from a very senior post and i've got a very rich experience in what the real problems are which we have been discussing since morning actually i had prepared detailed presentations which would have probably answered all the questions which have been put so far on the roadmap which india should do but given the paucity of time i will just focus on 2 come 2 components if i have time okay we have been very good in mechanicals and that is why india became the largest export hub of ice engine based low cost vehicles 2 wheelers 3 wheelers and other which is acknowledged across the world and statistics speak for themselves on that where today is that we did not prepare ourselves for the upcoming new technologies and for electric vehicles the 2 basic components that we need to understand and start manufacturing in india are the high power precious dc motors and their controllers unfortunately in india i have not seen any institute including iits i'm sorry to say which are focused on these particular segments which is power electronics relative to energy storage and electric vehicles the second is similarly talking about electrochemistries we don't have a single university in india so you name it research it i'll be very happy if you can connect me with one no single institute teaching or focusing on developing and teaching students with the we are talking about the skill management on the electrochemistries 2 of the largest csir laboratories working in this field they're all connected with new one isn't karyakodi sikri another is cmat therosaur terala this is has developed advanced lead carbon batteries they have also developed in house lithium technology the person having that team is also my friend but unfortunately as we have been listening since morning i'm i'm really appreciated the way mehta ji told the truth on a public platform on why and what our country is lacking so there you know it is very good to do academic research and publish papers do it plan you know at the cost of the government's money or the public taxpayers money sir as you were saying it is very easy to see and do those things without putting it into commercial use unless i know any businessman any investor would see whether your technology is making economic sense as of today because the world is not going to wait for your country they you are already much late as we know but if we do not do it even now then probably this benefit which we have today of being very good in the mechanical part but if you do not address the issues of the cell chemistries and power electronics then probably we would miss the bus and you know in in order to understand these cell chemistries don't talk about even lithium cells you know you do your you said you will find out there are 2 types of cells primary cells and secondary cells primary cells are those which cannot be discharged and secondary cells are those which can be recharged now let me ask you a very simple question and put this to you lithium is not something which has come out of the blue in your digital watches pacemakers we name any electronics portable electronics button cells and they were already i have a panasonic catalog dated 1994 what we are doing today or learning today of this batteries probably by year 2005 i was already done with what is happening because of my global network so with this i'll pass on to the next weekend because there are a lot of things to discuss endless discussion sure we have time limitation also yeah hi all so i'd like 1st thanks icat and policy times for such a great event and i represent asdc here which is automotive skills development council and mister migni has already introduced us as we're promoted by saam ecma and fpa we're also supported by ministry of heavy industries and we are basically into the skilling you know making an impact in the skilling ecosystem for automobile specific so definitely coming to electric vehicle which is the latest one so a lot of have been said since morning on fame and pli being for the faster adoption of electric vehicles and also the production faster production of electric vehicles yes and a lot of positive changes are happening but for supporting that is what we believe that we need to do the capacity building in terms of the human resource which we talk about to you know you have to create that ecosystem where the i mean somebody said here right that we do have the electric vehicle but there is no service technician who will service that electric vehicle so i think we are trying to capture that that niche area definitely it's a very nascent stage but we are trying to make some impact definitely talk about it in later stages at the moment i see there is one topic and we all are looking at that topic through different glasses so somebody said we should besides electric vehicles we should have other options alternate fuels of course if i say i'm coming from industry there are efforts on ethanol there are efforts on methanol one of those methanol buses were launched during this month only with 15% landing or even 100% landing trucks were also displayed while we have incentives they are not limited to electric they are there for hydrogen if i see the 2 ladies out here they are filling the gaps so one is filling the money gap which is leasing skilling up so now let's assume the 2nd round probably to make it more interesting what we need to do to make that 10 15 years of the journey what we are aspiring to become of course incentives are there for 5 years somebody said in the beginning yes they have to be extended but what do we need to do and in specific what i will do what me as an organization me as a entity what we will do that also please mention otherwise there are many gap areas which you have covered in your first round what do you feel what do you aspire to do so maybe 1:1 minute if you can speak because can have then one more round 3rd round too starting this time from the lady right sure thank you so as i said we are into the scaling ecosystem so just giving a brief on what asdc does is we start from creating the course curriculum so we can say when we talk about electric vehicle so we have already created more than 12 courses where we start from you know being assembling the electric vehicle the testing of electric vehicle the servicing of electric vehicle the sales of it 2 the driving of it so we do have courses for e rickshaw drivers so these are from the the basic which is what we are starting going further we talk about the capacity building in that part where we do the training of trainers for these courses so that finally they go and can you know train the candidates or the existing workforce so in fact lot of being is being done for the servicing if i talk about the existing workforce in terms of those technicians of ic engine they are getting upskilled where we teach them you know to service the electric vehicle so we are definitely the numbers unless if i talk about in today's context but yes the start has already been done so we are doing in fact we're working with mhi you can say in developing these courses and we are working with world bank to to impart the trainings on the servicing part of it and we are also working with ministerial skill development where we are talking again on you know training the trainers for imparting the trainings further and we are working with the industry also i would say so here i can say on the saar group which is like a liver and batteries where we are working on the upscaling of the technicians for the electric vehicle we're working with toyota and lowe's car when we were working on the hybrid vehicles the sales of it the service of that so we are actually i think making an impact definitely a slow and steady impact is what i'm looking for working with the industry working with ministries working different set of people you know and we are trying to make the i mean you can say increase the capacity in this for the electric vehicle anymore let's see we will be learning somebody from this side earlier was talking about the gap areas in skilling even i learned first time that astc is working with verdan to get you best of of learnings so yes please next mhmm thank you madam from my experience adding on to what you've just said you know electric vehicles you have to think from a different perspective what you have been doing so far it's good for the internal combustion engine business now for this i would like to see that there should be some kind of collaboration with those skilled counsels which are working for electronics sector steel council of india because everything in the internal combustion engines also because i've seen that entire history of where internal combustion engine were when there was hardly any electronics into that but now even internal combustion engine based vehicles you know there are a lot of electronics into that so now we need to have more synergy between electronics and this and then the other thing is we were talking since morning about the charging infrastructure it the charging has to be primarily done mostly from renewable energy based sources to make sense because again if you are going to use thermal power plants or cng power plant based charging stations and then run the then charge the electric vehicle then probably call it to me it is not a very wise choice so and then the center of excellence and then i'll finish i will interrupt again what others can do is one aspect as a capacity of what you are representing what i will do that also please tell me so i on behalf of the federation of electric vehicles decision while coming here i already shared my views with them that we will take up this kind of challenge to develop the centers of excellence skilling for the electric vehicle industry you have option to collaborate with asdc yeah so please you said no asdc should reach out to you please reach out to and together remain same thing sir that is the whole idea of networking and coming here absolutely thank you so i am from charging side so i can talk about the charging ecosystem because ev and ev charging is like a chicken and egg stroller where the charger will come first or the vehicle will come first so that is the thing so as a group we decided and we create the ecosystem and we are touch facing all kind of this thing like phone charging or you can say workplace charging bus charging all kind of systems we are creating so that when this journey because it is like we are in an essence stage everybody is telling that coming 10 years will be ev it is a big buzz every week one of the oem is launching 1 passenger vehicle or buses are coming up so it is like another 10 year would be ev only so for that we are creating a sustainable system and like i said electricity come from thermal and then you are charging a ev that is a big thing but you we are to give you assurance that we are working on that on the green energy and renewable part but it is like we are just started the journey like if you if i give you example of banking earlier we have only cooperative banking then we have state banks national banks slowly slowly industry will move so something like that in it will be happen in ev this thing also we have the renewable sources which we are creating electricity from renewable and then we are having the ev but we can now say from the very first day we can run a ev through a solar energy so that is my say we are contributing through creating a business yeah thank you okay just to address what we'll be doing as you see that was achieved through the ecma's contributions there is making all the industry as well as the regulatory agencies aware of the issues and the solutions so we'll continue to do that because again as i was talking about ic engines are going to be there for at least next 30 years so we need to keep working on that area we will be continuing that journey making industry as well as yes sir the regulatory agencies making aware of it and the urgent need to no sorry arjun need of focus to say for this stringent regulatory norms which is already adopted by the developing countries developed countries i would say where you know you can say take an example of europe euro 70 is already declared there whereas we are not even to discussing about it okay so if we start delaying that the whole population of current engines will keep on polluting the environment and we will not be achieving the net zero what we are dreaming about in 2017 so our major mission will be continues this journey of making aware of the impacts and sms our member companies are bringing out solutions to address or to be equivalent to a i would say making a competitive challenge i would say to the cost costly solutions as of today that is the electric vehicles so those kind of solutions to bring out the help of maybe alternate fuels or even you know hydrogen it's not just a loan on the ic engine per se it should be in the oil refineries oil you know fuel making or fuel manufacturing so those kind of industries also we'll be interacting with and bringing you know all the stakeholders we'll be taking them along with us while helping the government to bring out the right policies and strategies yeah this is a very important point you said not only 30 hours we have paid that 2 zero seven zero we'll be doing net zero so we still have time and probably this is the time we can even taking clue from global south what we are saying in g 20 maybe for people like africa we can provide latest bs 6 phase 1 phase 2 engines and we can serve that better definitely lower cost and one more thing as a oem we all now are thinking that we should develop engines we should be fitted for diesel cng hydrogen or methanol yeah it should become a kind of engine at all so those modular engines are already kind of you will see the light and announcements going forward that you're going to see just to touch upon that even sorry for that but even 2 wheeler industry today we know about 20,000,000 are being produced but it's hardly 2,000,000 is getting replaced so it's only 10 10% this by 2 30 2030 it will be polluting in say pm 2.5 which we have not talked about a gas engine this is also a main health issue that need to be addressed and is the solution available the solution is available say like gasoline that is particle filters so solution is available so the norms are not too broad in and it should be deployed then only we'll be achieving the you know clean environment what we are talking about and the game mission that's it thank you yeah thank you my name is yeah one of the most important i would assume but in my opinion how the country can to answer your first question how the country can contribute to the journey ahead is by developing an ecosystem and that entire ecosystem would probably include all the panel members somewhere right so setting up an ecosystem selling or manufacturing the vehicle is just one bit of it but at what cost are you manufacturing that what are the regulatory compliances legal legality aspects of what is the financing aspect of it because financing decides the adoption in the country if nbfcs like me or banks are not providing the right kind of financing to the actual adopters in bharat we divide it as india and bharat unless there's actual mass adoption in the bharat region of our country we can't potentially assume that ev is going to go where we think it's going to go so ecosystem creation is 1 and how we are helping is we are the enablers sir we are larger messaging is financial inclusion we want to include the 6 to 10 crore indians that are still not part of any formal credit in the country and unless we bring them to a decent enough platform to access credit they will never be able to access an energy asset like an ev so our goal and mission is to finance and to enable close to 50,000 to 1 lakh vehicles over the next 5 years and we see that we have seen a good 35 40% month on month growth in terms of supply of vehicles more than that the demand of those vehicles so we have a very positive outlook and we believe that as enablers if you're able to outside of just providing vehicle financing if you're able to create a consortium of services which will be a one stop solution for my any ev driver who wants to come and get an ev he gets an insurance he gets after aftermarket services he gets training so there there are a lot of aspects to it so i think how we are contributing is by helping in developing that ecosystem at whatever level and capacity we can and to take it forward from there yeah maybe we can have 2 words last panelist and we will open for q and a okay what we can do we can do on the man material marketing and we will for reducing the emissions i have a 6 acre farm in sector 115 order where we are setting up this virus and this is all two sides there is a big road so we can provide then i have already offered to the outcome for for this isb or it can be powered there as a 24 hours power line and 4th thing is that we have developed the technology recently only 1 military and prime minister and so we are we are developing filters so that a carbon can be extracted and from that we are making the manner and that has been only on the 24th 25th and 26th we have at the national science center near so we are making chrome that is carbon rich organic manner so we are developing we are developing this for the auto vehicles also and we are developing for the all little people also if there is any like is that the third one is can be at any time i mean if there is a radiation so kindly make 1 room in each home there we can convert carbon to the oxygen whatever is done in the 1 carbon technology so these type of the we are also developing filters at the badi factory and the imachal pradesh so it can be fitted into the old vehicles where the carbon can be extracted and that can be converted and that can be used for the manual the carbon so about the marketing we can plan at the nida this type of the conference i can provide free of course in the soviet university or in the gnit so we can do this type of the conference regarding material there is a previous usage there he's having lot of resources in in the china so we can purchase this lithium cells and if anybody wants to have the battery battery he want to manufacture we can give the technology for this and we have mister sgs who is the chairman of we will have some question answer session but i believe it's too late because we are there since morning so we will directly go for lunch and we will have the networking time there etcetera happiness comes from the justice justice comes from the sovereignty of mind and sovereignty of mind comes from d type of the conferences d type of the discussion and regarding the food i can say knowledge is like food whatever you have eaten that is not important important it whatever you have digested so whatever has been said here you digest it and do it from tomorrow go of course we are collaborators we are competitors nikki is journey major investment here knowing that tomorrow will be those kind of electric vehicles will be there up as a group charging and infrastructure to provide anticipate facility could provide the rent so that that that is really wonderful thank you to each one of you because we are contributing yeah please please that will be a big game changer all of my colleagues will agree here battery initial quality battery",

        "name": "Welcome Remarks by Radhika Kalia, MD RLG \uff5c Conference on Role of EPR on circular Economy",
        "content": "director rmg india to kindly deliver the remarks good morning everyone and thank you for coming today we are all celebrating the global recycling day today and it's a very i i would say it's a very hardest moment because we in india are trying to do recycling activities since last almost 10 years from 2012 when the rule came into being before that i would like to welcome all our guests and prestigious invitees missus motuba the honorable high commissioner kingdom of lesto then we have srivet prakash ji who is the director hsm division mefcc and sushar singh ji rati sir as well as nitin so all the dignitaries on the dais thank you so much for attending and making it making your time available for this catherine i just had a small note while there is an increase in manufacturing and changing consumption patterns which is generating more employment and increase in per capita income the effects of such higher production on the environment must also be efficiently managed and mitigated so hence it's important that the global recycling day is you know celebrated with lot of joys and pompous thing because of course we can't add media and entertainment here but this is the need of the hour within the 2% of the world's land mass and 4% of freshwater resources a linear economy model of take make dispose which we are totally you know focused on would constraint india's manufacturing sector and consequently the overall economy therefore it is essential to recognize and revolutionize the material flows and only the recycling domain can help us doing this because if we do not do our resource recovery and we do not take care of our natural resources we we i'm sure we all know this that the climate change and the changes which are coming in would really affect us and mankind could cease to exist i am quite honored to having worked with moefcc since 2010 where the first rule was drafted and worked very closely with cpcb in making the guidelines on how the end of life would work and then followed by mister widdh prakash in 2018 when they changed the 22 when they changed the rules india has seen a lot of evolution from 2,000 16 till 22 in the changes of rules whether it is plastic electronic tires came in and of course i believe battery is also there and oil epr starts from 1st april 2024 so many changes are coming and we are also having an end of life has implemented textile epr soon to be is uk in 2025 they shall launch epr in textile and it is said that the textile that mankind has generated can last 6 generation and there is only 1% recycling effort in it so the plastic and textile could actually ruin what mankind is making with the extensive consumer consumerism and you know we have enough of clothes today and we keep buying but we do not know how to dispose them and how the epr would exist and soon we will see that mister vivekash has been very kind and the way he has adopted the epr system is just a first first step to circular economy where the epr credits today we are working very closely with cpcb also helping our producer brands for getting apr credits now this is a new portal for e waste plastic is still settled there are challenges for the users to put in but those challenges are showing that the downstream which is being measured for every product category whether it is metal or nonmetal would further enthuse the producer to check where that material actually is and once the producer starts asking the recycler that if you have given me credits for iron aluminum gold or copper i would like to buy that back once producer starts buying these metal or non metal products back then is when the circular economy would start there is a paper also is working on in 2021 along with meti and there's a lot of deliberation along with the producers soon i would see that this paper would engulf targets for producers that the product that they use while making the newer products they need to design for recyclable material and that would be a full loop for circular economy to come and play and how india is shaping up with leapfrog activities which the government is doing and implementation of the rules i'm sure we'll be able to you know understand how of course there are a lot of chaotic challenges alongside operationally but we can make it out because we indians are very good at leapfrogging and doing our act well so it's hard to see the global recycling day when all of us are here and how recycling actually can shape up as an industry the other day we were meeting with our shareholders with dpi secretary and he was saying that recycling should be coined as an industry plus the service providers should also be recognized people like rng should be recognized as service providers as enablers because currently the reverse logistics is not under the guard of any industry there is a service industry which talks about it travel agents insurance banking but they do not talk about reverse logistics the key to success to circle an economy would only be reverse supply chain management and that is how to bring back the product from the end user be it bulk or be it consumer as an end user as an individual consumer so that would be a big challenge because the consumer behavior in our country does not change and to make that change a lot of effort has to be there and in the morning i was speaking with 1 of the ngos they said that best management is actually not happening in the country because the consumer behavioral change is not happening so that's a bigger need of the hour how we all everybody present in this room would work towards changing the behavior of end user and bringing back the full unit because there is a huge informal sector which helps does a lot of cannibalizing so the inclusive approach of the informal sector is also pertinent along with people like us who enable collection from the market and bring it back to recycling and doing the reverse mechanism thank you so much for your patience hearing and over to you",

        "content": "introduce and welcome our guests policy dance chamber of commerce i also want to welcome our secretary doctor ayan chakraborty welcome sir and the moment our chairman joins kindly let me know so yeah he should be on any moment policy times chairman of commerce since last 4 and high half years almost 5 years now has been relentlessly and consistently working towards policy advocacy our mission is bringing development in the country and in the society okay the pillar of bringing development is policy countries or nations which make good policies and implement them are always successful in terms of bringing socioeconomic development so since last 4 years there are 4 5 sectors we relentlessly work and contribute in nation building one of the areas that we work is health care health there is a very important domain and sector which which needs a lot of yeah which which has been i'm just yeah spotlighting our speakers so that now we have recently organized india health care summit in siliguri thinking that siliguri is one of the important domains or important strategic location of eastern india you know which has which is connected with bangladesh nepal bhutan neighbors around it and also bihar the the entire eastern india is well connected out of the discussion that we one of the areas where there was unanimous you know commonality and agreement was bringing ayurveda or yeah in the north in this eastern india when we did identify that then there were couple of suggestions which came out one of those suggestions was a medical college private medical college in siliguri and couple of wellness centers world class international level wellness centers and some ayurvedic medical college so the journey started from there and when we started discussing we got a couple of interested investors and interested persons business leaders who are interested in establishing and investing into ayurveda that was the logic to start off this discussion and that was the objective to start off i want to before i invite our chief guest to deliver or give his remarks out of the discussion what we want is we want our investors who are joining us in the discussion and some experts from southern india who are joining us are from across northern india especially including the ministry of ioush and some of the medical college ayurvedic medical college entrepreneurs and manufacturing company leaders who are joining us from south india to exchange your view understand how we can start a ayurveda center wellness center or ayurveda medical college what are the prerequisites what is the re what are the requirements and then how is it commercially viable what are the systematic reforms that we need to bring in in especially when we talk about eastern india especially bengal and northeast these 2 one state and region are our focus area so now to briefly introduce what our the national committee is doing i will request natish balasa to introduce say a few words then i will as a convener of the national health care committee i'll request him to speak then i'll invite our secretary to speak now this sir over to you yeah good evening to everyone here and i first of all thanks birakram for this opportunity and i want to welcome all the dignitaries taking the time to be on this show today and as well as our audience i can see that i mean there are almost a 100 people here i just want to welcome all of you we started this journey especially in the health care i've been associated pulse times i think for about 3 years now and we our mentor doctor shekhar who's unfortunately no more with us put us on the path he was a great advocate of nation building and he he has increased us right from the beginning and whatever we do now we want to commit in his memory and take it forward and we had an excellent health care summit in siliguri about 2 weeks ago where we we had a lot of business talks and we were able to put together a few you know investments there and we are committed i'm from chennai lifeline hospital i can see our chairman doctor raj kumar there is also the chairman of the policy times committee health care committee raj can you come in and say something yeah i think he's in the theater yes can you unmute him akram can you unmute doctor rajkumar yes hi doctor akram how are you very well sir great to see such a well attended meeting i would like to thank doctor akram for putting it all together i know that we and thanks to doctor natesh and doctor ayan for co hosting it so nicely i know that we have a huge number of people with us we have people not only from the policy times we've got people from the ministry and a lot of other doctors i'd like to say a big hello to everybody is doctor is mister nigam there is he gone are you joining sir yes sir that's right is mister nigam coming is he at there because i already met him that's what i was saying mister nara nigam he's not there yeah yeah now i can hear you i can honorable secretary gp is with us government alright wonderful upadhyay sir it's such a pleasure to have you with us we really appreciate that you're here with us today and to all the other dignitaries on behalf of my very dynamic group of policy times people doctor akram doctor natesh doctor ayan and and doctor suptan and a lot i would like to say a excellent very very warm welcome to everyone excuse my clumsy outfit i've i've just been i know that doctor iron is there we've just been doing a difficult cancer stomach of the mother of one of his friends and the good news is of course irony managed to take it all out and she's doing well but it's fantastic to see all of you now the fact you might be wondering why we're doing robotic surgery for cancer stomach on one side and on the other side we're looking at traditional medicine we really believe that you know why then are in no hurry and that all all roads lead to healing and i'm a very firm believer in traditional medicine and i think if something can be alright with some traditional medicine we shouldn't be doing some big surgery for it so i know that people think that allopathy is equal to antipathy that is not true certainly in our hospitals i'm sure doctor ayan and doctor natesh both my senior colleagues will will will reflect my thinking that we are not only we don't believe only in allopathy and we are very very wide open to participate in traditional medicine i'll give you a simple exam about 2 3 weeks ago i'd gone to kochi to meet mister raila odinga who was earlier prime minister of kenya he stood this time for president and he lost narrowly he's a personal friend of modiji and his daughter with a degenerative retinal problem had been completely checked at moorfields eye hospital london at agarwal's at shankar netrelia and they all said you can't do anything he went for traditional medicine he went to shankar yama ayurvedic eye work and i promise you within a month when i went and saw her she could see properly wearing glasses and those guys just saying no no we are not happy with this the doctors in another 1 or 2 months we throw off the glasses also and get it back to normal so this is obviously one anecdote but when i went around the the shreedhar yaman that that entire institution that's a 10 or 15 acre institution only for of eye diseases jam packed hundreds and hundreds of patients so there are so many things that allopathy doesn't know we are completely wide open we welcome our brothers from traditional medicine with open arms and we are very happy to participate in today's function and i would like doctor natesh and doctor ayan to to take over with his brief introduction since there are so many dignitaries and so many speakers i would like to wait and watch and and learn from everyone thank you thank you so much sir nothing sir a brief welcome remarks for our honorable chief guest and then our objective our committee and then we move forward the discussion okay thank you thank you doctor ashma but there sir good evening to you thank you for joining us and the the the last week 2 weeks back we had a summit health care summit it started in a very small way ended up in a very big weird celebrity i was there personally we were very honored to have the district magistrate there who happens to be from state of tamil nadu and you know he's been there for 10 years in darjeeling and he was wonderful in welcoming us and promised us all help so policy times health care committee is going to do a lot of work in bengal especially so we want to we we've already been there in bengal doctor raj kumar and i visited it many times we also tied up with the medical college called santri ketan medical college there our aim is to bring technology and medicine at which we are very good into the northeast that is one of the first aims we had there and then as we started discussing with more and more people we got we got request for also supporting in ayurveda that's how this summit this meeting is coming about like doctor rajkumar said we are very very firm believers in what we call holistic medicine sir we are not we we truly recognize and understand our limitations of allopathic medicine indeed i have personally witnessed many miraculous transformations in conditions chronic conditions like autoimmune diseases where we don't have any answer at all but ayurveda and other natural sciences seem to play a huge role and we are indeed a few days back i was talking to i met doctor manavalin who is the director of the state in at tamil nadu institute of yogic sciences and naturopathy he was very very keen he he he's he's a wonderful man who's got tremendous knowledge in ayurveda and he's very keen to start ayurvedic centers in all hospitals and he you know we welcome them to lifeline and now we're talking about placing also an ayurvedic heart doctor at the hospital so with these few words i just want to say that i think we should combine and bring back the traditional system of medicine as in addition to allopathy because i don't think one can replace the other i think we should combine both these systems and ultimately ensure that the patient has benefited from the you know immense knowledge that both the systems have to offer so at the higher level policy time the health care committee we want to ensure we want to assure everyone here we're going to use all our connections all our resources to facilitate act as super connectors to different groups and see how we can put together and evolve a system of medicine which reaches patients well and takes care of the problems with that i will hand it over to vikram again akhil thank you so much as part of our committee our secretary dukan chakraborty joining us also ceo coo of shantinikanth medical college west bengal and also one of the very dynamic leaders in terms of facilitating bridging health care collaborations between states and also between different verticals of health care so the small well before i invite our chief guest to speak yeah thank you mister akram thank you sir and doctor rajkumar sir and doctor nates sir to have already with us who are there and almost waiting for i mean the people all delegates all dignitaries there oh there with due respect to all just a i want to highlight i want to focus certain points like what are things what we did actually what was our plan when we started this kind of thing for west bengal development so the thing was the thing was to have a proper investment in the areas of the north north bengal where there are the scopes to go for i mean open scopes like we have come with certain phases of ayurvedic college certain phases of medical college certain phases of like nursing and paramedical college certain phases hospital they are asking support from different areas different states say for chennai say for other hospitals for improvement of their health certain pharmaceutical manufacturing companies to come over there and to sit and to manufacture so in those different projects we achieved we got achieved we got we got some certain investors we got certain years where we can expand the scopes of having this ayush system completely in north bengal so we started working on that so what happens out of that policy summit in shiliguri on 15 december we have got certain projects certain investors are very much interested for going through that so there so now the question was like one everything medical call let's say for i mean some investors were asking i mean they came with the question that i want to start 1 i have a medical college so what are the prerequisites certain pharmaceutical company they are asking some prerequisites certain pharmacy college there somebody came us came to us over the same day and they are having a plan to open a pharmacy college so like that these colleges this medical college ayurvedic medical college specifically the prerequisites we wanted to clear it up clear discussion about this so we searched out i mean the best possible people of country would came off and today with us all the people are there and i personally being a radiologist i have seen the ayush how it helped i i was in kerala for 6 years so there i i worked with certain stalwart people i have seen and i have seen how fistula they treated it out in ayush how different types of diseases like spinal problem orthopedics issues congenital problems they used to get cleaned up by our ayurvedic medicines and i worked i had got opportunity to work with doctor rabiner doctor nambudiri and all the people i was having so i mean these people knows me i also knew their work and all those so today i mean when we got the opportunity to expand the north bengal in putting this kind of ayurvedic medical system ayurvedic pharmaceuticals over there pharmacy colleges so we are i mean very eagerly waiting for the prerequisites what are the prerequisites how we can plan how many days it can we can develop how many hospitals we require or what is the things we require what are the system we require so today we came with this summit with this meeting we want to specifically highlight all the investors who are ready to invest over there for ayush and with the system director health secretaries honorable so these all people are there so today by this discussion we should have a complete follow-up of the system and we should start this kind of projects as soon as possible this is our policy time's main mission and i think today after this meet we can definitely and landed up with some good projects within very near within maybe within a month or certain thank you so much now i'll be covering amin again giving to mister akram about the next part yeah thank you thank you so much sir indeed very short and brief before i invite honorable secretary secretary sir to speak and to deliver your chief guest remarks chief guest remarks i just want to tell to our audience that i'm we are really we apologize we we only have 100 people's window in zoom we cannot take more than 100 i would request my team to kindly share the zoo our facebook and youtube live link to all the participants who are willing to join i understand there are a lot of ayurvedic doctors are joining from nepal we have a very big delegation because nepal and india collaboration is also one of the factors that we wanna discuss now before i hand over and request our honorable chief guest to speak sir the purpose of this

bangladesh which gives us an immense competitive advantage to become one of india's famous and prominent dominance prominent you know hub to be a medical medical hub basically or health care service providers hub now to introduce our chief guest shri gp badhais sir is the honorable cabinet secretary of government of sikkim sir he's one of the most dynamic leaders that i have ever met when i met him for the first time the kind of ideas the kind of activeness and a kind of simplicity i found in his approach was evil was really attractive he was very to the point of simple elaborating he explained everything what is required but it was very simple so that any layman can understand that sir has been secretary general before being the cabinet secretary sir had a very has had a very long tenure to serve the government of india the country and government of sikkim sir was secretary general at feo federation of indian export organizations where sir led a lot of you know he initiated introduced lot of exhibitions to promote india's export then sarawak's commissioner and secretary beef after that for for around 12 years then sarawak was also commissioner with government of sikkim sarva became an additional chief secretary serving education tourism civil aviation commerce and industries and sarva was also principal secretary in charge of tribal development women and child development minority affairs social justice and empowerment so a long tenure serving the people of sikkim and people of india i would request our honorable chief guest to kindly deliver your inaugural address and then we will discuss the business discussion we'll start the business discussion thank you akram i think i'm audible yes sir you're very much audible okay so all the distinguished people who are here in this important meeting and i i wish a very good evening to each each and everyone and i'm humbled by the introduction given by akram actually i was lucky i got this opportunity to serve in the is and i have been in sikkim and delhi and up serving in different capacities and i have had the opportunity of serving in different departments which give me a very good exposure as well as in the exports exports sector now as it happened there health summit in which which was told to me by akram and i was very happy to know about the proceedings of that successful summit successful meeting in seliguri sikkim is a small state and but it is known for its you know good governance good policies and cleanliness and law abiding citizens so there are a lot of positives about the state which are known to outside people and we have had a good development in the field of education especially also in medical education we have we were the first in india to enter into an mou with manipal group to set up a public private partnership university which became a model role model for the private university revolution in the country and all of you know that there are you know now hundreds of private universities so that was the first time that any state started a private university and now we have got a medical college of course manipal group is it for 1 50 seats we are setting up we are in the process process setting up a bigger medical college in the state sector also we are positioning sikkim as a very green investment destination for in in in few of the niche areas like education skill development in case of agro processing because it's an organic state perhaps the only one in the world and also in the field of it and then some other related fields so basically we already have a large number of pharma company in the state thanks to various incentives being offered by government so this when this this information came to me through akram that there is a online meeting regarding this ayurveda and naturopathy and all that i immediately told him that sikkim is positioning in a big way as a very favored destination for ayurveda and health resort in the state i mean few of them because i have seen many of them in kerala i have seen them in bangalore in others other places patanjali is doing in a big way i feel sikkim has got the right climate the right kind of you know clean air and water and there are some very good locations which are available for setting it up and government is all willing to support in whatever way government of india is coming out with a new policy which will give tax incentives to people as well as capital subsidy to the people setting up such ventures in the northeast sikkim is part of northeast so we we would be very happy if we can you know work on a proposal to set up an ayurvedic medical college because we already have an allopathic one and what i like the most about today's deliberations was that you know before me the eminent doctors who spoke briefly that you know we they they said that we are not against naturopathy or ayurveda actually allopathy and naturopathy or ayurveda should complement each other they're not in competition with each other where the other one doesn't work the next one works the next one doesn't work the allopathy works so i think it's a it's a combination and ultimately the patient should benefit the patient should get the benefit of the either ayurveda or allopathy or whatever so we would be very happy to have such kind of proposals coming to us in the month of april 1st week we are having a summit where we would like to invite some of the people as our guest to the state and they will get a chance to meet all the people there prominent people and honorable centimeters and governor and of course we'll be able to take the proposals forward so i once again i it's my my privilege to be part of this deliberation and i am here to basically learn from all of you whatever i can do from my side in terms of promotion of these things at at the state level or at national level i'm always available and i wish a very successful deliberation in the meeting thank you so much thank you thank you so much honorable secretary very short but very very impressive you know speech you have highlighted how sikkim i mean one of the secrets of sikkim paths' story is that it is very simple straight and to the point you know sikkim it's it's not very complicated it's very simple the climate is very welcoming not on not only in terms of weather i don't know whether you're able to see me or not because i'm not able to see my myself in the frame we can see you akram we can we can see you okay so the second thing is the climate is the people's behavior is wonderful you know people are very welcoming industry so if any industry leader goes there or wants to invest you know the the wealth the people whether this is political leadership bureaucratic leadership or even common people they are very very welcoming and forthcoming in terms of investment so we would be also very happy to help honorable secretary sir to you know make the event a grand success and also we would be extremely committed to bring serious investors to the state so that you know we make sikkim it is already a big business hub in terms of health care investment now we can also attract investment in education we can attract investment in many green technologies we can bring investment in you know this as this is also one of the core areas where honorable secretary kevin seguicar is focusing so we'll be extremely happy to support you and help you sir now we we to move ahead and we'll be very happy sir if you are with us for a little more time or will be always you know

starting off i just want to introduce for a just a short seconds introduction he is a a superman i have seen ever at least i visited him because i know him i have seen him to work so i mean he is excellently treating fistulas i mean in that system so what previously our chairman was talking about about that ayurveda system is not like some other system rather than allopathy or something some competition and all those it's not like that so again and again it's proving that the doctor chipati sir was superbly treating the spinal issues ortho issues and fistulas so mistake i've seen him like more than a very good and well known allopathy people doctor raveena anjapadhisar was treating the patient like just like minutes so i've seen him so he is here and he wants to give his best advice for how to expand the alveitic system completely i use our expansion in north bengal so he is with us now and just requesting sir to come over here doctor raminarayan can can you start please yeah yeah yeah sir actually i am waiting because hazra sar is also there and he told that hazra sar will start that's why i'm waiting anyway okay so it's all it's all right so my humble pranam to all the dignitaries especially to gv upadhyay san and mister akram and doctor ayan has given a very good introduction for me rather it's my honor to be here and the thing is i am not a businessman actually i am throughout my life i am in teaching i'm a professor and i'm guiding the phd and pg students simultaneously i am also a pg here so what doctor told i am practicing mainly crystalline orthopedic cases anyway that will discuss later and what our upages are told that if it is integration that integration does not mean that to replace 1 party and to add up another party rather it is always it should be peasant centric wherever there is some problem in the peasant and whoever can overcome that that party has to be started so it is not like replacing for example what sar told in this july actually we are having 18 different ops at amrita institute of medical science and once in a while or whenever there is some patient they are collecting some pistilate patients and i used to travel from kolam to kochi to treat all those cases because there are so many different that's like you might be knowing because all so many doctors are there so they know about different treatment of fistula so many tremendous advancement is there but still some tracks are like so much fibrous that the the probe the ultrasound probe will not enter into that so that they cannot do the wap technology also so in those cases our treatment like carousel treatment is very good and we we can give a better outcome so this is actually not according to the topic what akram sir told me before yesterday that i have to give a keynote address so i have prepared a very small powerpoint presentation some 6 to 7 slides so and i want to show that particular slide because there may be so many people who those who are not belonging to this traditional medicine or those who are not doctors for them i think it will be a little bit it can give some more highlights some more lights to those people that's why just allow me to share my slides you can share doctor yeah so actually i initially i have told that i am not a businessman but still i can give some highlights and whatever the objective you are having to start a wellness center or to start a hospital or to start a medical college in their concern being i am working as a administrative post in the ananta school of firebase that's why i can also give some some of the clarity to that so today actually the topic is traditional medicine and global health so while we are telling about global health and traditional medicine first of all we should know that what traditional medicine means some people tell this traditional medicine as alternative medicine but here i can highlight that it is not an alternative medicine rather it is the native medicine so which has in propounder which has been started in india since maybe 5000 years ago and this is the most and documented medical system so and i can tell if we are telling about this traditional medicine then so many other branches may also come like ayurveda acupuncture siddha so many different system may may come but being a person of ayurveda i can tell that this ayurvedic system of medicine is very good to treat almost all types of chronic disease so that is only a little bit thing another if we are mixing it is global health then you people may be knowing that whenever we are doing some functions whenever we are doing some spiritual function or some cultural function some of the rituals at that time there will be a swasti martin right so this is a very common sanskrit shloka used to in day to day toxins so from there that means what i mean to say in our in the thought in the indian mythology we are going then it starts with so here there is no one 1 is not there always we are thinking about the community always we are thinking about the people and that means the global health so that's what i'm telling that our indian thought or the in the thought always tells about the wellness and the health health and wellness for all not for a particular individual rather it is for all so you might have heard about doctor ms vallayatham so he used to tell he has written so many books on being a very good cardiologist also he has he has the like that book he has already written which is coming under these bestsellers so before going to do anything first of all we have to we have to clearly understand what is traditional medicine and what is global health so traditional medicine there is no need to tell anything about this traditional medicine because you know that the skill and practice based on experience are indigenous or which runs from generation to generation which there are which is treated by means of different herbs plants minerals all those things are coming under this medicinal medicine and i hope that this one part of that which is the mostly almost all types of disease are mentioned in this ayurvedic text and we can treat almost all types of disease also and when we are coming to this global head at that time global health is also it is not a very small term whether it is a very big term where you can tell where the research study practice whatever it may be always the priorities would be even towards improving the health status so and when we are going to we are going further then we can tell that actually now this is the middle of the time we have to start and we have to do something and ayurved has a greatest potential to do on this needs of the global health and there are so because in the month of april the global center for traditional medicine was already established and during that period you might have heard about this so what is the why it become so much prominent and why it started government of india thought to start this global center for traditional medicine because now it is a integral resource of the health from centuries and around 88 countries and more than 170 member states they are using this traditional medicine and though till now it was not highlighted and the people have not realized the potential of this ayurveda this traditional medicine that's why now it become very much essential to collect the datas and to highlight and to promote this one so and we have to think about different global health issues also and those health issues if you can answer then that will be a great help towards the propagation of ayurveda propagation of the traditional medicine and we can achieve the global health also so just there are so many healthy search but even few if the more important things we can highlight here like pandemics so pandemics there are every year there are new new different new new emerging pan pandemics are coming and too much of threats to this human being and here the health education and herbal practices by that we can overcome so on on this type of issue i can tell only highlights of these issues like some environmental factor pandemics economic disparity so if this economic disparity in the health care there there might be so many people those who may not able to get all types of health care facilities because of their poverty so business when we are going on business at that time that business if we start then that may also be helpful to overcome this economic disparity then some political factors maybe they are then noncommunicable disease and animal health all those things are also coming under this global health issues this in city and pandemics all those things you might have seen during this covid time how the ayurveda and ayurvedic tara and all those things have done a tremendous work for this covid 19 so if we are thinking about the solutions then to ensure the healthy lives and the promote well-being of all at all ages so many different avenues are there like holistic health herbal medicine periodical purification by means of panchakarma compatible food and nutrition like there's so many yoga so many things are there by which you can overcome all these global health problems or global health issues so for that opportunities if we are thinking then the we have to think about the fundamental health sector needs so whatever the fundamental health sector needs are there if we can do some improvement on that then definitely we can reach up to our goal so how that these are the opportunities i have i have just quoted few of them like educational institutes wellness center pharmaceuticals quality control lab research and analytical lab health centers super specialty centers like one of the speaker was telling about the sri daya hospital which was established in kerala so that is a specific for a particular disease only it has been established then other than that also we have to run through so many different types of research fundamental research rct all those things are required but while we are doing it the discussion on this business so this business actually i can give a quote here that the global goals are in the business only and the global goals simply cannot be achieved without business though there are core operations financial commitment employment network all these things are there so many investors may be there they may be thinking about how much finance is required to start a hospital how much finance is required to start a health center how much area of land is required to start a college and what are the infrastructure we want to start all those things it can be discussed in slowly slowly in a single meeting we cannot define all these things so i can tell you that one one website is there from ncism and ccim 1 ccim india dot org in one website is there in that website everything is mentioned whatever the impression that is required what are the minimum standard of regulation is required to start a college or wellness center and how to apply for that application format everything is mentioned there only some commitment some committed people is required to start the progress so by this only i can conclude my talk because there are so many people to discuss about all these things and some question answer will also be there so finally i can tell so lord may bless you all the whole world is 1 family thank you thank you very much doctor rabinara and tripathi that was that was a very very lovely overview of traditional medicine you have responded to us and very informative thank you sir we'll come back to you with questions after the other speakers have spoken can i invite doctor jairam hazra to talk next doctor jairam yes may i have the call yes you are please carry on sir namaskaram very good evening to you all my all my respected dignitaries i didn't mean to this meeting first of all i pay my heartiest thanks to doctor ayam chakothi and akramji for whom today i attending this meeting although for a long time i was not in touch with this or other research organization or education for last 3 years i retired from my service out of 30 year service in the ccrs centre council for research in adoptic sciences what experience i gained that few important points i would like to highlight today first thing is we have to see the quality what so giving a good deliver sam actually i wanted to say many things about under quality control the establishment of all these things but what i want to say there before establishing any college any pharmacy any medicinal plant garden any laboratory r and d because r&d is most essential for nowadays to reach in the global market for business purpose although i'm not a businessman i'm purely a technical person postgraduate durabogoon which is medicinal plant specialist anyway for last 30 years' service in my ccrs but i observed that we need quality colleagues quality teachers quality medicine because few pharmaceutical companies for their business they are preparing the medicine without maintaining the quality even sometimes we observe that simply a child class a good immuno producing medicine 75% quantity having the unlucky but few companies reputed companies i i don't like to tell the name but in my experience what i observed that instead of amla they are using some potato and some some other things so how the quality of chompass will maintain so if we want to take the desired effect from the medicine definitely we have to in the quality medicine quality plants for cultivation preservation and we have to take the help of modern medicine the tools parameters various technology or modern science without the technology tools and parameters even we cannot have the aiu systems that's why i always say has to maintain the quality of teaching i mean teachers then quality of hospitals then maintain the quality of the medicines which we are using for the persons so that we can get a good ayurvedic systems and for that reason if we maintain the quality then we can reach up to globe market without any hesitation but without such it is impossible and what doctor tripathi also told it's my first time and what i think that we should sit together face to face and various opportunities are there for ai system not only ayurveda ayurveda yunani shivdha jovo naturopathy so if we establish the ayurveda hospital yeah ayurveda college but definitely we have to see the policy of the central government i mean policy of the ministry of ios what they are they are policies they are adopted for college or a hospital and for pharmacy etcetera so definitely i i don't like to say more about the all these things so next time i'll say in details thank you thank you to all thank you very much doctor pradeep hazra thank you for reminding us that it is important to maintain the quality and of teachers hospitals as well as the medicines and for sharing your knowledge about you know different plants that you spoke about we will definitely take all this into consideration and for your information sir we are working very closely with various groups to set up ayurvedic colleges we are facilitating definitely one in the northeast and with our honorable secretary upadhyasa's support we we hope to set up one in sikkim as well thank you sir for your presently i'm retired person i can always i'm with you with your organization no problem sir we look forward to your advice when we start these we will reach out we'll reach out for sure sir thank you thank you so can we have a professor kuniraman if he's available now actually he his audio he he's there with video but he's not able to come with audio his audio is not working so we we can invite jammi sir and kanaya sir okay let me okay let me introduce doctor nassim and jammi sorry go ahead akram yeah so to take the interest perspective pradeep sir will take but jami sir and kanaya sir will give the industry perspective now because they belong to industry let us have the industry perspective fantastic fantastic and doctor narasimhan jami who is the ceo and director of jammi pharma is a is a medical doctor but jammi pharmaceuticals is a 125 year old organization he's a 3rd or 4th generation he will tell you more about it jammy you're on thanks doctor natesh nice meeting you here again on this forum it's a very wonderful surprise so thanks to the siligree meeting of natesh and i and our colleagues have you know set up a very good you know collaboration where we've actually we've done what you know doctor rajkumar has said a collaborative effort in trying to use both the allopathic as well as the ayurvedic ways to address human health now since this is a policy times chamber of commerce session i wanna talk about policy right so there are 3 very important things that i wanna touch upon the first one is r and d funding right r and d funding is very very critical for any field for any science to move forward and we are aish needs r r and d funding and one of the one of the as far as r and d funding today as the situation is today is that there is only funding available for classical ayurvedic preparations which i don't think is the the necessary is is the right way to go about encouraging ayurvedic scientific growth because i would as a science a very pure science and i'm a scientist i have a postdoctoral fellowship from stanford in molecular pharmacology the the the people who are going to decide on the funding merits of any proposal should be scientists along with ayurvedic positions the ayurvedic positions should be the ones wetting out the ayurvedic potential of the project whereas the scientific merit of the project should be actually decided by scientists who are running it has to be a collaborative effort so that is as far as the funding is concerned the second thing is the opportunity from the business perspective from the industry perspective is ayurveda has one of the most facile and a comprehensive solution for lifestyle diseases lifestyle diseases are are the ones that are going to be the biggest problems right now immunity obviously as we've seen in covid has been a huge issue and nothing seems to wonderfully address the covid situation as traditional medicines especially ayurveda and in tamil nadu even the cabozero kudinir has really helped in the curbing of the disease the other lifestyle diseases like cardiac problems fatty liver and liver is a the liver is a problem that is actually the government of india has added as one of the big four of the noncommunicable diseases and that's something that ayurveda has got wonderful solutions for and the the last thing that i wanted to touch upon because i'm i'm very very conscious of the time for the other honorable members as well is to make sure that we as a community practice integrative medicine i think that's been the common theme from all the speakers so far let's not throw the baby out of the bathwater let's use allopathy where it's absolutely required and let us absolutely not shy away from where you actually think is going to be the primary way of treating a person thank you doctor natesh thanks for the opportunity and thank you akram so much for having me on board thanks thank you doctor jammy that was so clear short concise and again very and thank you for reminding us integrative medicine i think like you said is the way to go forward and very interestingly you know in allopathic medicine world over we have moved from communicable diseases to noncommunicable diseases like rightly said noncommunicable diseases are lifestyle diseases and it's very important for all ayurvedic practitioners to recognize and treat that you know i it is allopathic medicine has started the shift from reactive medicine to preventive medicine and i think ayurveda also should start practicing that having said that one of the important points which is keeps coming to my mind is somehow we all should try and promote awareness of ayurvedic medicine which i think is lacking you know people now like doctor tripathi said that's that's the traditional that's native medicine that was what was available in india i think years for for generations and you know beyond that so we should all policy time will take a decision and we'll try our best to promote ayurvedic medicine and then create awareness about what benefits it can actually give to patients thank you doctor jamia again i now invite mister kenhaya mandal to share his view the industry perspective as our current calls it sir the floor is yours yeah good evening thank thank you natesh sir and thank you mister eknam to inviting me in this forum i also i am having very gratitude for all these distinguished members and chief guest who given some light upon this and with the medicines and something that is going on to appreciate this industry and to get it more popular for the health and well-being of the people at a large we have also seen that our there's over the asset pool that in sikkim they want to have one good institute over there and i i was there in sikkim for 15 years oh i have seen the atmosphere and the working culture what it is there because basically i have worked in allopathic medicines only since last one and a half year i'm working with the ayurveda medicines only difference that i can tell you that while i was working in allopathic medicines i never used to take my own medicines just to be aware making the medicines for the others but while i am working in a ayurveda factory so i used to keep some medicines in my drawer as well and on regular basis when i am going on the soft floor so testing of medicines means by testing by taking the medicine for me itself that is the difference between the advaira medicines and the allo gut medicines doctor jairam had said very significantly but very pointedly he told that there is some quality aspects which need to be addressed so i can tell you that while i i had done the pharmacy at that time i studied that how the gmp from so gmp was not evoluted from the regulatory body it was evoluted from the industry itself so more and more in this industry will propagate the quality system will definitely it will come anti it will take into the place of any other test on that the problem with that this medicine is that all the raw materials at the house which are the geographically best components are there so it to test in a laboratory it is very difficult so i'll discuss something more about that some of our earlier guest also told us that there are some prerequisite and something else that is required to establish something so for industry point of view i may say to you something which my network more than 2 to 3 minute so let me allow to share my screen please go ahead sir please go ahead is it seen to you sir yeah we can see it please go ahead sorry it is not moving so so you can make it full screen mister yeah yeah yeah screen is moving now yes yes it is yeah so already it has been discussed that the on medicine which is the ayurveda unani siddha these are the 3 medicines which is frequently used roar sipa is another type of medicines we it is a himalayan drugs there's a one university it is situated in the lattaca another about another one i am not aware it might be something or somewhere there so another one we we have seen that the homopath medicine is also very much popular in india however source of this homopath medicine was in german and it was initiated in in 9 sorry 17 196 then we also know about the chinese system of the medicine so for the background and all these things these ramon the parties are already discussed in the detail so we will not go up on that one so we already know this is the oldest form of health care system and even the these modern medicines were derived from the this network source only we have we know that i have with i and only what it means for the health care so it has also been this holistic approach that we have discussed in the and it has been elaborated in detail by our previous speaker so we'll go to another one that we have seen that doctor jairam hazra who has come from the nri dd and ccr is these are the pioneer research institute by from the government of india and today this impcl is the contribution from these institutes only because the manufacturing of drugs and the results it was very closely coordinated by these institutes so at number 6 we see ai the this has been it is operational in the new delhi it is same as and so what we are seeing in terms of the modern medicines and recently the nium the national institute of for the united medicines it was inaugurated in the lucknow and there are so many government hospitals for which the these advaitic medicines can means these medicines are being used over there so all it comes under the government of india this is the for the for the for the the center for the research in the united medicine anything else sir no no go ahead go ahead go ahead because there is some disease leak i didn't know how it begins no no please go ahead please go ahead yeah yeah so for this even the governments and some everybody are also taking care of this medicines man vaccine so for any manufacturing medicines we we need the global marketing so there is a who jmp certification is required impc certified in terms of that one for marketing in india only only gmp certification is required licensing is a must for this we want to manufacture any product and distribute to the public we had also some of our these are previous speakers told us that there is a difference in the classical and probiotic medicines where he asked that some funding is required for the research of these admitted medicines i'm pleased to say that few months back i have seen that ministry of ielts has greatly promoted of this ielts medicines he has already fund to for the manufacturers even for the even private sectors also even they have someone want to set up the level 3 they want to upgrade the level 3 they want the certification of the who means some financial ad is also government is giving to promote the ad medicines manufacturing so critics and sort comments will be there like what the the has a result that in 7 classes someone who is using alu someone who is using this kado something these are the things because the problem is that we doesn't have the testing procedure exactly because in the 7 plus almost 45 to 46 we are adding in that medicines to manufacture that product so how to identify the individual products individual ingredients there's no established procedure over there so quality policy we will not discuss over here so so but to manufacture any products in the in this and unani so there are some reference this is the not the only reference books there are so many books available with us to which we are manufacturing any classical medicines for any proprietary medicines the people start doing their own research and establishing their formula so api misadmiric pharmacopoeia of india it was initiated long back but actually the working on these details of these law health minerals and pharmacope systems well since last 1 or 2 years the committee has started very seriously working over there and very soon means earlier there was a part 1 now in terms of part 2 the formulas and energy procedure also given them so someone if one twist and initiate with any industry so these books are the simple reference book for them and word by word they have to follow them so we will not go 1 by 1 this is this is the things that we are following now what different formulations we have in the ayurveda means very intelligent medicines which we are manufacturing in any industry so it is a tablet so we have seen that tablets and all these things in the allopathic medicine system it's a very established position but it is not in this one i ayurveda so they are following the this modern medicine itself and gradually it is being standardized and for the future there will be the good procedure and the percentage compliances will be there so the another last one is there the what is the business prospect and the possibilities for this medicine so typically this is the example for my own company the last 10 years these are the it's the sales data so we have seen in after the pandemic this one covid 19 so the productivity has been increased by lakeland bond and saw the profitability of this company so that's all about of this business opportunity in this one so with this only i would like to conclude my slide and if anything else for the on a personal basis then i i may answer that one so thank you thank you sir that's all thank you thank you much mister kania mandal very very elucidate presentation about the regulatory controls and for all our audience here i want to say if you want access to the presentations of our different speakers get in touch with us at policy time and with the permission of the authors we'll be happy to

gp sir secretary and all the participants dignitaries from different like issues and companies actually it's my privilege to be here with you to discuss about something about the health search council so that is the ethical governing body for the research and the study in their country so actually it is there to establish the some policy level guidance to the nepal government through the research and the and research related activity in the health and it's an ethical body so actually it had banded to do research and and to to promote research in the country so it's an it's an ethical body and the research policy and research priority that is was said by nepal research council that is related to the nepal health policy yeah actually it has 4 different mandates for the research governance in the nepal like the most important mandate being the ethical regulation in the country so that's why we have ethical review board in the center and that is led by the independent research scientist and and we have a committee independent medical colleges and the institutions so that that that are taking care of the research activities in the country and second being the capacity building so we are training different types of technical persons in the in the health research as as a capacity building like different trainings and actually we are planning to have just master's phd program in the research house so that's why we need some collaborators for the academy is activity in in the country and the part of doing the is in this part of the and for being the promoting use of the evidences so one of the objective of the council is to work on the traditional medicine and the medicine that is the objective of concepts so for that purpose we have one of the like in in the of the board so there is there may be the research scientist from the eye with the background also so that's why it's important for the us to discuss about the health related activity through the in the in the in the medicine in the culture so that is being emerging in our country and and actually i'm clinical pharmacologist and a drug specialist working in the institution like in nepal one of the biggest medical ecology in nepal so i'm a clinical pharmacologist and and professor of that issue so being a pharmacologist and drug expert and and and executive of the nepalese's council is my role to promote ayurvedic and medicine in the country so we have the renowned one of the the like ground scientist from the different diabetic and and clinical research background in the country we are working on the clinical research capacity building activity in the in the country especially during the covid pandemic we we have tried to establish clinical trials and our design and the study and and and including the clinical trial of the ayurvedic medicine products like ast stmr 2 and 3 quarter combinations so we have tried the clinical trial of the ayurvedic medical product also and we have to establish some type of different types of labs and having the international type of lab for the genomic and biomedical and the precision medicine so we're working on the clinical background so we have very much reaching the medicine plan so you have you know so if you see the different medical like i have my medicine plans in the country we have high media high high altitude medicine plans like if you see i got a mercy if you see yasagumba so that is one of the very potential for the anti cancer molecule and then like it it works like so yeah and we have like different types of medicine plans for the psychiatric disorders and then the cancer activity also and and taxes you know pay a packet taxi so that is developed from the taxes so that is the original source is the the nepal so so yeah so i have one of the interested scientists in research in the nepal's so he will tell you something about the different types of possibilities of the medicinal plant activities in the country so i i'll give time for 2 2 or 3 minutes and in in a organization leader so what i want to tell you all people that so you are you you know there are so many scientists or or some leading or my leaders also and and like industry people and the policy maker so i had to meet the secretary also so i wanted actually i wanted me to secretary when i were in the silvery but i could not manage time so i because that's so it is a it's a national leader of the research in the country so i want to meet new people officially and i want to tie up you officially so that we can do so many things in our country regarding the ayurvedic and medicine in the country so you are mostly welcome actually we want to have some collaborative partnership like public private partnership can be done through the councilor agent so so there are some of the partner companies in the agriculture that they want to establish r and d in pharmaceuticals related to the ayurvedic sector so that's why yeah it's very hard line we have hard line to work on the r and d in the ayurvedic medicine and trace medicine sector and also like we have very much well known drug like so that that can be researched also and and we can sort to to the interesting level that we can do so many collaborative activities as well as like not only for the research you can plan some of the action design also randomized control trial and that can compare to the clinical or telepathy medicine to the eye of the medicine also so that can be the possibilities so we can work in many ways so that's why i request all personality and dignitaries to work together on behalf of the council we are ready to work together so that i wanted to know like naive like communicate and and like work collaboratively so what i wanted to like inform you that we have already done mou mutual understanding with icmr indian council of medical research one of the component of that mou was the work on the research and the study related activities on the with medicine so that we can work directly with the institution if you if you have mou because icmr and the other government organizations so if you tie up according to that mou that will be very much easier for us to work further also and and i i met the is secretary in delhi so when i i was there in the countries of the world i'm in the congress in in like india so we can't do so many work regarding that with the ius also in in that medicine and the medicine and i again thank you all like especially for inviting me and giving a chance to say something about research council and the like possibility of the research activities led to the testing and i want to know i have to share one of the information that we have mou like going to mou our agreement with the harvard medical school genomic and patient medicine center so that is one of the component of that agreement is the pharmacogenetic study study so we have to establish such type of research activities by working with the harvard and then make and and medicine activities so that can we can work together so yeah so i'd like to request a bit of questions is this the 2 it says 3 words regarding the medicinal plants in the country so we'll take 1 2 minutes on it thank you very much we have done some isolation of pure component and evidence generation and standardization of drug as well as clinical trial of iv formulation for example fenugreek is in clinical trial for diabetic patient st and also nhrc as well as nepal academic science and technology was in collaboration with csir lucknow india who has isolated taxol from texas bokatta of nepal nepalese origin and as well as the our drug which is very important for kalajar is isolated from delphineus adesis which is patented on canada as well so

reconnect i can reconnect yeah we are we are very late you know but yes sir please go ahead sir please go ahead yeah yeah yeah yeah only one 2 points i have to i would like to share that is the post covid era globally demands us to have a paradigm shift so what is the urgent matter is that we must we must have a very stringent policy of in all aspects all aspects even academic nonacademic pharmaceutical and and and all aspects we must have a bad and also the priority must be some speakers who are offering on that so our priority must be with r and d r and d also that is one point and second thing is that instead of holistic we were using the word holistic we would stress on the way of integration integration integrating all the streams all the streams and give and take whatever it may be whatever it may be we have too much in the integration of all the streams and as you know we i represent as network treatment center started years back whereas as everybody knew that we treat a snake sir integrating modern and also ayurveda so that is the that is the usp of our organizations and we have a plan of starting this integrated treatment of snakebite patients by through telemedicine we have a project on that we have already discussed it is is under government and also we are planning to have discussion with the state government also they'll need this in treatment to snake bed patients however it is all over india and if you have we have we i am very much delighted that nepal the representative the head of the nepal nepal fraternity has been all will offer support for traditional medicine and also ayurvedic medicines and hospitals etcetera we hope that we can join together and next year we are planning an international summit in the northern part of kerala that is my district kanur southern part of india so i welcome initially welcome all of you to participate the general summit actually we are planning that by the end of next i mean this year but only that much i can share in this very very late night thank you thank you all thank you professor such wonderful words thank you so much sir we will get in touch with you to take forward all these projects that you have just said sir thank you so much for your time can i invite missus preeti mother ma'am are you there missus preeti i can see her there yeah ma'am is there yeah ma'am hello good evening am i audible yes ma'am you are audible now okay okay sir yeah yeah i know it's pretty late and we have a few of your words there ma'am yeah sure sir sure okay sir i'll let me introduce myself i'm doctor preeti madhav chandran and i would like to thank the organizers for inviting me as i would i would say that i'm partner in the sinai advaitha center my hospital is in the suburbs of el nakhlom pucci care it is situated in a very pristine surroundings and it is an nabh accredited hospital so basically i can say that my connection to my hospital though i am a doc i mean i have a phd it's in management so my connection to my hospital is as part of its administration and hr and the overall running of the daily operations so i would like to share my experiences regarding the administration side of running an ayurveda hospital so actually as i said my connection to ayurveda is through my husband doctor vimala chandran who is an ayurveda physician and he's the chief physician and cto of our hospital so according to ayurveda i'm not an expert in that but i would say that ayurveda means a science of life and it's a fight 1,000 year old science but a very actively practiced science and it has a very high regard all around the world and basically as a team of global health and i i would say that we have a very good international clientele who's very much passionate about ayurveda we have people coming in to learn ayurveda we have people coming in to treat their ailment to ayurveda and also obviously what ayurveda is in a way there is a thin line written serious ayurveda and what we call as ayurveda the pre the wellness aspects so all these things are what we touch upon in our hospital and our hospital is in a very pristine surrounding so this is one of the very important aspect when you start an adi with the hospital i know it it should be in a very pristine surrounding very peaceful because most of the people who come here they come here for ailments and they come here for wellness treatments fine but at the end of the day ayurveda believes in the policy of treating mind body and spirit so a pristine environment along with good quality treatment good hygiene environment good quality as already the speakers have emphasized good quality treatments good quality and knowledgeable doctors doctors with tremendous experience in the treatise all those things are very important and for us we believe that our guest is very important whatever the guest says about their you know about their problems and issues we take lot of care to correctly understand diagnose it our doctors try to understand this our chief physician is very particular about that we give lot of importance to the learning about what are the what exactly is the issues with our what is our guest or our patients and customizing the treatment all those things are very important a punctuality is another very important thing quality of treatment is again very important thing and actually ayurveda has divided into i know 7 aspects categories which again i don't need to emphasize because we have experienced persons who are part of it but i would just say that it is internal medicine gynecology pediatric ophthalmology surgery toxicology then geriatric psychiatry so all those things when you start in adelaide hospital all these things can be included as departments in your hospital you can include penvos genealogical doctors for all these departments we do have few of these departments in our hospital then regarding the administration but interacting with the patient from the time they land in our premises then making them at ease settling them down then all those things are given prime importance communication with the well patient is also of prime importance because most of the time they believe that most of the people want listeners so all these things are what we emphasize on and in our hospital we have the medical department we have the administration department and we have the hr department then there is accounts department because handling the we have international clients we have domestic clients so handling all those things that are very important so we require an accounts department then we have a diet kitchen to customize the food for the patients then we have housekeeping department security so all those so what holds an hospital together it is basically a team play it's a team everybody in the hospital has to synchronize and work together to make an hospital into the quality or the goals or the aims which is the or the vision to meet the vision of the hospital we are setting up so all these things are in brief what i want to say and i mean i think majority of the doctors are ladies and in our hospital also we have around 60% of our employees are ladies including our doctors we have seniors chief physician and senior doctors who are males including my husband doctor madhav chandran along with that we have lady doctors we have good masters of high quality we mentor them we give them training so all those things are the factors we have to look into and also we have to look into all the statutory norms and government rules regarding hygiene regarding certification and so it's not easy as such to run-in ayurveda hospital it's as as tough as running an allopathy hospital so this is what i want to emphasize because people feel that ayurveda has a concept that okay people come for a spa or people come just for a massage and all those things but no ayurveda is and especially b 2 are into serious treating of serious illness as well as the wellness part so emphasizing on quality emphasizing on hygiene emphasizing on good doctors good knowledgeable doctors senior doctors teamwork benchmarking yourself standardizing the procedures and systems the oh the emphasizing on even the minute parts of the or daily operations all those things are very important as far as an ayurveda hospital is concerned it is as good and as tough as running at hospital because we require an nabh certification we require iso certification money again is a mandatory part we require marketing to be done so these are some of the things which in either way the hospital requires and and and i think my experiences cannot be shared in a very short or a brief stint it is a very you know it's it's a daily interaction it's very you know you you deal with the different kind of people different nationalities so it's varying you can't say can't predict that you have 10 patients you have done well no the other 10 patients you which come will be totally different from the experience which you had no so all those things are very important all these things have to be kept in mind while you know dealing with an ayurveda hospital or running up an ayurveda and of course medicines all those things are important bringing in i if you're in if you manufacture your own medicines fine otherwise i think it would be better if you include a standardized i know that a lot of manufacturers who bring in who have a standardized medicine so opting for those things and all are very important so i think i think these are few of the aspects or the experience which i can share as in the what do you call the administration aspects and hr aspects of and running and hire with the hospital maybe if there is more time i could share more personal experiences because every day is a different day for us in an ayurveda hospital but in overall it is very it's a beautiful experience because at the end of the day when you get a good feedback from your patient who's recovered who's who tells you yeah i came here very happy and destressed i'm not only cured of my illness but i'm destressed i'm very happy i'm more happier to face the world go back to my work site with a better frame of mind motivated well that is one of the best things which i feel is is part of my job which gives me happiness so i think this is in brief what i can say about running an ayurveda hospital and in case of any other detail you can always contact me thank you thank you thank you so much doctor preeti that was that was a wonderful explanation of how you can running a ayurvedic hospital indeed i believe that india it's high time that you know ayurvedic hospitals also go the corporate way as more adoption happens just like calipathic chains of hospitals ayurveda also has the potential to go cooperate and become chains and the way you are going madam i can i can assure or be very confident that you probably will be the first to set up a chain of with the centers and policy times we'll be very happy to support you in that ventures so i think we've come to the end of speaking session it's already been very late but somehow i feel the time has you know been so consuming because of the wonderful quality of the speeches we have heard so i'd now throw the floor open for a few more minutes for any questions because i see a large audience still about 50 people we had more than 100 people initially fifty people still patiently there if any please unmute sir sir please unmute yourself sorry about that so sorry okay so any anybody can ask questions now to any particular speaker or generally we'll get someone to answer them to you so you can either write in the chat box or you can also with your voice you can ask a question anyone if you would like to ask hi my name is prahlad hi sir i'm from chennai prahlad since all i have a quiz for any doctors in general i mean particularly to doctor jammi do you have any pressing diseases right now that can be addressed only through ayurveda doctor jammi would you like to take that yeah yeah yeah i would actually so this is a this is a very interesting question there's a book i wrote over the covid time and it's called the orphan's father this specifically deals with diseases that have been orphaned orphaned by allopathy but have solutions in ayurveda for a for a very long time and one of those diseases that is now having a huge impact in the immune society is cirrhosis cirrhosis of the liver ayurveda treats it very very well you know people as later stage 3 cirrhosis have have been reversed again this is something that is very very surprising to a lot of people that they know especially the western scientist and other pets they say that cirrhosis is not urine the only only way that this is using a liver transplant but that's not true we have our own clinic here in chennai where we've treated the several cases of cirrhosis reversed them successfully that's one disease the other one migraines migraines irritable bowel syndrome fatty liver i mean you there are a lot of diseases my recommendation mister peralta is for you it's a shameless plug but please buy the book on amazon the auctions father i wrote it a couple of years ago and it addresses a lot of diseases that can be cured by ayurveda that the alopetathy does not have solutions for thank you thank you very much doctor jammi i see another question from manbir thank you pralad for the question manbir can you yeah yes sir good evening sir thank you for lovely insights my question is regarding the insurance sector like if we are talking about taking ayurveda to the corporate level at policy level we also need to inculcate the health insurance sector health insurance sector to incorporate more policies that can give people the insurance coverage for even ayurvedic treatment before because when i researched most of the health insurances only give reimbursements limited reimbursements they do not cover hospitalizations so in order if we want to give it a universal approach i think we should our policies should have more health insurance coverage that that's a beautiful question manbir i i i think it's very insightful yeah i'm having one thing like according to the question right now that policy that insurance coverage usually in some part of different area of hospitals in ayurveda or ayurveda they're getting coverage for ip patients if they are getting admitted in some emergency basis like severe fistulas problems severe pain back pain and all those so they are getting admitted for that they are getting that kind of insurance in that way emergency basis admission and they are getting the insurance coverage the complete one and if it is like a stable one but chronic one so that policy we are to like universal policies to make and to approach in that way from our side oh thank you thank you darlayan can i also invite doctor preeti who is already running a hospital you know can you take this question doctor preeti how does it work in your hospital do you have insurance coverage some yeah yes we do have insurance coverage but as it's already mentioned it is reimbursement because most of the insurance policies unless you have an even if you have an aus policy in your insurance policy it is mostly reimbursement there is no cashless policy as such it just come into existence so this is what we have been trying to cover and but most of the i mean almost all 99% of the insurance companies are reimbursing every i mean they are reimbursing all the amount for ayurveda treatment in fact i think only some companies maybe some around 1,000 rupees or 2,000 depending on your policy they cut otherwise most of the patients they have been getting almost the entire amount and but the thing is you have to first mention to your agent that you will be going for ayurveda treatment so the the it starts from there so that is the first thing you have to do the first stepping stone is just inform your agent or your company that okay i'm going for ayurveda treatment and then and then we can get a a reimbursement okay thank you thank you so much doctor preeti for that thank you so much akram i think we should make this a point you know and and we should take this up with the insurance companies manbir thank you again very interesting point and we will definitely the chamber of commerce policy times will take it up with the heads of insurance companies and we'll see what we can do to push this one more question from sameer jamacha can you unmute and talk please thank you for the giving the opportunity so i'm from i'm i'm from the far of everyone for the northeast and part of deepura so okay my actually i'm working for the long time from study from in china also so i'm the my suffer there is the basically i've developed the liberty everything so our side from the buy bond to buy bond my forefather forefather the lot of the we have developed now i am developed the like practical example i've given the bamboo leaf tea okay so i have so so read right to the fsss and then so there was no recognized light so i i've been office also there their officer also i'll meet so they're also telling we need the calcutta you go to the blah blah blah blah so but we have the forefather to forefather in china also everywhere you tell there there is the very nicest silicon of the bamboo leaf everyone study so that was that i've kind of now recognized the ayurvedic system so what type they recognize what type they what so many explanation so that was the you think our our side of lord of the wider system we are called the forefather of traditional method we have the billace level we treated no nothing that we think does so so that was the main basic thing there's there's i mean example for the simple example so lot of the no no no recognized for the fss those fss and then some some were insurance like for that so there was the what what what can can everyone mute please yeah okay thank you go ahead so please you see that this matter of the basically for the and attach for the enclosed for the the void door our village level lot of the till now no recognized but is the forefather to forefather we have the practitioner so that okay let's keep the question thought what actually mister sameer is asking there are a lot of you know traditional vipers like right village you know quad doctors you can say then they are they are not certified neither they are approved or authorized so he is requesting is there any process of like recognizing this 100 years of their practice and you know good so what what would be the answer to this our regard maybe or else we will try hello please unmute sir or sir please actually actually each and every state having their own eyes drug controlling authority 1st the person who is doing the work on ayurveda or folklore medicine or traditionally they are using the medicine from 4 father father father that's should be submitted to the state drug controlling authority for taking the license first and if we if we have a totally unknown medicine other than ayurveda and it is not mentioned in ayurveda then it can be taken for patent has to take the patent apply for patent and you'll get the patent otherwise you have to take the license for 3% of eye breathing medicine from drug controlling authority am i clear yes sir thank you so much sir doctor jairam that was indeed very clear i request sameer if you need more information please do get in touch with us at policy time and we will try and get you more information on how to go about doing this thank you sameer for the question can i is there any other question i don't see any raised hands so akram i think we should have closing remarks because it's only 2 hours now right sir it's almost 2 hours 2 3 questions now right there are some entrepreneurs so one with regards to medical college so someone wants to start a private medical college what is the approach what is the minimum land requirement we have and then what is the overall planning to start a medical private medical college that is one question the second is there is potential of northeast and bengal to be a wellness hub or i use tourism hub now what how do we start where do we start from so jiram sir maybe if you can and koni raman sir if you can also come in and ravi sir is already here where do we start if an entrepreneur has 4 of zamil a land then how many buildings do we how many can start only hospital within 4 giga i mean no college will be permitted from ccim because ccim center counselor in their medicine is the canceling authority recognizing authority for starting the establishment the college so past you have to approach to the ccim for establishment of college and for that minimum probably presently minimum high vehicle plan are required as per my notice probably for establishing college only but for establishing hospital hospital a 100 people hospital you can start anywhere with no problem definitely at present as per as per ais ministry it is i was nabh you have to maintain all the guidelines of i was in ibh it should be maintained properly what is the ideal thing to start with sir is it a wellness center anshkarma what where should because you know no one would be willing to invest a large amount of money at the first goal but some somewhere there are some industrial you said you can start wellness center then panchakonu center panchakonu center is a super specialty center for for panchakonu center we need only very less land only i mean within one particular you can start also because it's still like a clinic you know and you can start also panchakarma hospital only yeah tharasutra hospital we we you know the charles sutra is 100% and result you can get even panchakon also it is very popular in kerala and why not in bengal so if he started in bengal and especially north bengal then it's only very good thing for ayurvedi hospital a lot panchakarma institute panchakarma center panchakarma hospital or char sutrin institute char sutrin institute char sutrin center yeah char sutrin clinic or char sutrin institute also so we have 2 field 1 is panchakarma and one is means it's a good thing we can start immediately and ayurvedic hospital having all the departments that will take time we need a maximum facilities or suppose for cellular department for cellular surgery department for cardiac support medicine department so for them to start all these departments i mean to start the hospital we have to follow the guidelines of nabh definitely i was nabh not modern nabh i'm sorry are you clear yes sir very clear ravi sir yes sir sir actually i want to tell you something when we are defining health and wellness these two things are different when we are telling health means merely absence of disease but wellness means there will be social well-being spiritual well-being and physical well-being also so and when you are telling about are the establishment or from where to start so before starting we must have a good vision and mission so that means suppose you want to start a hospital one big has happened is enough no doubt about it but if your future perspective is to make it a college then minimum 15 acres of land is required because in at present 3 different criterias are there if you want to start a 40 intake college then you need you need only 6 acres of land but if the intake capacity is becoming 60 then the the area will be doubled so you you can start with 1 acre of jam and no problem in that but there must be some avenue that it can be extended so if you have to select the area where around land you can acquire then within that boundary you can start in one acre no problem in that one thing then second thing if you start a hospital you can start a super specialty hospital you can even start with opd and then it can be extended to ipd there is no harm in that but if you want to start a wellness center then wellness center is little bit bigger than a hospital that means if a person is coming you have to give also type of support to be well spiritually then physically and mentally also so you have to establish minimum center 1 medicine opd simultaneously karasutra then some yoga center then some spiritual talks you have clients all these things you collectively is called as a wellness center so like that you have to start so what i mean to say and another is there every day today the ccm is regulation is changing in that ccm i told that 1 ccminindia.org.il one website is there where everything is mentioned what you have to do how to put the applicate application first of all there the the local university has to be approved then state government has to give the approval which is called as loi then after that you have to approach to ccim or ncism they have to give a permission to start the college but before that initially you have to give a application to start a college and then you have to start a hospital so that hospital has to run for 2 years after that only one eligible to start a college so initially it can be started like a hospital that that is a clear cut answer then depending upon the financial constraint you have to think whether you can start a hospital or a wellness center so anyway college cannot be started all of a sudden initially you have to i think thank you so much for to everyone for joining us and making the program such interactive and success i will request our convener natesa to give the closing remarks and then i'll request answer to formally give the closing remarks so yeah i i yeah thank you akram and thank you for all our dignitaries and all our audience it's been such a wonderful discussion all around so so i just want to summarize with few points what we've all agreed upon after this the last time we had the conversation like this about health care in the northeast north east bengal north bengal we ended up in at least 2 mous and about 5 more discussions so at policy times whenever we have discussions we always make it a point to note down action points for what is going to happen next because we don't believe a conversation like there's a discussion like this you just get over with one discussion but it should definitely result in concrete steps and that is what something we are very keen to do that and when we did it last time we have got 2 moes signed so i assure all of you that we will work very hard to make sure concrete actionable items are worked upon and at the end of the day some some result oriented actions will be taken and you can always get in touch with us for more information so we all agree that the way forward like professor kuniraman said integrated medicine is definitely going to be the way forward and like most of the doctors here and scientists said r and d is very important maintaining quality of teachers and hospitals is extremely important maintaining the quality of medicines is extremely important and we are going to work together to facilitate across state and across country collaboration and to summarize the whole thing and to with my closing remarks will be policy times chamber of commerce will work very closely anyone all the entrepreneurs the organization owners and the the scientists and the technical people we will put together anybody who wants to work with other people looking for collaborations looking for investment we will act as a nodal body and we will support the growth of ayurveda across the northeast with that i hand over the thing to akram and to doctor iain thank you so much everyone thank you sir doctor iain chakraborty sir you're closing thank you thank you so much mister akram and doctor nadez sir and thank you all the dignitaries over here and till we got all the points and just in a nutshell already doctor nadez said briefed that just to add one more thing as we have seen this is preeti madhuk chandan what she told that to keep all the faculty all the facilities you know ayurvedic medical college also like all the units like all the parts like pediatrics gyne and all those parts so there's a absolute fantastic idea because we got cifor as a i got the opportunity to have us i mean to take a speaker part on mri improvement for the people for ayurvedic medicines so like that those is very important for ayurveda part to make more cmes more workshop before whoever is going to put harvard medical college or io system in that area so this is one take home point that we are planning now in a nutshell i'm just finishing this that we are on the making of the projects 1st starting with the wellness center and ayurveda hospital and then going to ayurveda medical college as early as possible number 1 number 2 the 2 keep there some manufacturing companies i mean who are making ayurveda medicines or pharmaceuticals in northeast in specifically shiliguri or darjeeling or sikkim and r and d to keep as max as possible max over there in that area and apart from this chronologically another pharmacy college all are regulated all those research centers and other areas so we will be projecting all this very soon and max as fast as possible within next month we are going to plan and project and finalize thank you so much thank you thank you so much doctor anjapur okay so with this by thanking to all our respective speakers jairam hazra sir our ma'am preeti ma'am also joining us you know being with us here unfortunately we could not have",

        "name": "Panel Discussion 1\uff1a Automobile industry expectations from Vehicle Scrapping policy, ESG, & EPR",
        "content": "panel discussion is on automotive industry expectation from vehicle scrapping policy esg and epr following speakers who will be sitting on the panel sri sudhindu sinha ji is the adviser to niti io and his core area is infrastructure connectivity and electric mobility vertical doctor manish jaiswal director netrex manish ji is working with netrix from last 20 years and responsible for various automotive r and d's mister prashanthi banerjee executive director siam mister uday narang founder and chairman omega seiki mobilities mister rahul bhardi executive director corporate planning government affairs at maruti suzuki mister jespal sachar vp corporate affairs assup leyland and mister yashodhan ramteke cofounder of blockon and blockchain esg expert so starting from mister sinha sir rvsf policy is rbsf successful automobile industry or stakeholders is a related collaboration or cooperation sir we'll need your guidance how to go ahead how all the automotive stakeholders can get benefited out of rbsf so please guide us thank you so in fact i frankly speaking i came with the purpose that i should be listening to the auto industry players trying to find out that was what exactly their expectations are and what are the missing gaps which probably you know on the government side we could be giving it a push yeah we know it well that this is an absolutely challenging kind of ecosystem that we are trying to set this informal sector i won't call it a problem you see yeah that's that's something that has been existing there so we are trying to kind of i would call it to reskill them upgrade them integrate them into the system that is that we want to achieve so taking them as a part of as a piece of problem would be a wrong approach so you see you i'm sure that since morning you must have got all the information that how precisely this v v m p and this vehicle scrapping policy this cable so frankly speaking it it owes its from the prime minister prime minister was of a view that if our infrastructure is developing if it if it is so we we always take pride in saying that great ways are there and roadways every day we are making such great good roads why it is that the kind of vehicles which are still on the road that is not the upskill at least the the visible part of it he was more he was more concerned about the government vehicles so i mean the idea was that ambulances the kind of ambulances that are on the street they are in a more rundown condition than the patient that they are driving and the police vehicles of course you know you have got the typical police vehicles of course don't see it in delhi it is it is absolutely modernized but if you see if you go to the mafasir areas police vehicles are there ambulances are there fire tenders for example number of government vehicles vehicles in fact if you go to any police station of of tier 2 city you would find that there is a stack of police vehicles over another kind of thing that is a normal sight you can identify that if it is like that that has to be a police station they call it pounded vehicle whatever you call it so the idea was that they should be given a big push and of course the private vehicles are the second ones so we started it and big is also something that i would like to share with you so i've got a piece of information that i just now already collected from the mstc people just asking them that how exactly they have performed so they were telling me that if i if i just share it with you so i was told that almost 25 1,000 vehicles have so far been you know processed by them processed by them they have been the auction is over and out of these 24,000 vehicle if you 25,000 vehicle if you see the breakup close to 15,000 are the central government vehicles and out of that 15,000 7,000 vehicles are the vehicles of home affairs so basically police and allied kind of vehicles are there and then state governments vehicles are close to 9 1,000.9,000 odd vehicles are there that belong to state government and in that i am watching that you know gujarat mp up maharashtra delhi they are the main shareholders the idea is very clear and these are the biggest for which we are giving them money for the replacement so you know it is not only the certificate of deposit certificate of deposit is just a kind of evidence over and above that we are there's a clear cut financial allocation for the change of vehicle and the type of vehicle that have been changed is 2 wheelers and 4 wheelers are of the same number close to 6,000 so that is the kind and the buses are there trucks mainly the best performance is of course other than home affairs defense people have performed very well naturally once you know they understand that replacement is coming and becomes easy so coming back to the point that what how to go about it i see it as a 4 pieces 1st piece as you mentioned that the fee nest the second piece is that it is it is an initiative where high initial cost is required so you know you have to go for a technology on those things the processing because we expect we compare ourselves with we want to compare ourselves with kind of say belgium if we're frankly speaking it is a belgian model it is australian model on which the entire vaguely scrapping facility we have developed it so where there the percentage of extraction is close to 80 to 9 percent in addition to almost all vehicles going back to the day there are 2 double advantage on our side number 1 the vehicles are not coming to the right place number 2 the extraction percentage is also close to what 60 to 70 max to max that's what the percentage is and 3rd piece is that even if you feel you know if you have done all the good work what is the guarantee that you will be taking it back to the circularity so the market of it is all these three pieces are there i'm sure that there are multiple methods through which you know we are attempting to solve them and i'm here to listen to you that listen to all the panelists plus all the major audience that how exactly what exactly we could be doing see we are ready to do we are very much willing to do please come out with your with suggestions and that can be taken now i would like to request doctor manish jaishwal director of netrx sir please guide us on how what automotive industry should expect from vehicles scrapping sir so all these are the resources yeah see i will take the support which nitrax can extend but i will like to add perspective on you know so on this whole formalizing of perspective on you know so on this whole formalizing of the scrapping thing through rbsf so as a country since we are starting as this you know in the initial journey we need to learn the lessons from the other countries and i feel we need to break that conundrum that it should not be just looked as a ferrous and non ferrous extraction problem because if you are just limiting yourself to ferrous nonferrous then those roadside guys who are doing it from us so many years will do a better job yeah at a much cheaper rate so why will the rbsf you know economy pick up so unless we try to take it to the next stage which now the eu is trying to do inform of in terms of creating policy like you know certain which guarantees certain percentage of the nonferrous materials to go back into the supply chain for example they are creating or framing a rule where 25% of the plastics is reused so when you have that sort of policy then you bring in the the value addition which these advanced centers can do because that the you know informal sectors cannot do they will just extract the metal or the parts and try to sort of sell it in the other market or they will try to sell it as a scrap but once you bring down this things which are you know and that is a you know 15 to 20 percent of overall mass so that is a significant mass and if that is brought into the formal thing then it will add value the second thing is on the asr part the auto automotive shredder residue which japan has taken a lead and they have developed a regulation which ensures that after it goes to the asr it is not just ending in the landfill and our current policy has no guidelines on that and even many other countries don't have whereas japan extracts the the energy as well as material out of asr and there is a huge scope for innovation for reuse of this type of fine dust fine particles those foams those plastics various types of elastomers which comes out of that so unless we create that you know ecosystem the value addition with this advanced centers will do will be very limited so that that is my it might take so unless we need to i'm not saying it will happen immediately but at least we need to have a road map for that and once you have the regulation that yes the automotive companies have to declare what sort of a recycle content goes back into the product it could be a starting level let's say i'm saying 2% of my stuff is recycled so that declaration plus certain regulation which says that a certain part of the thing goes back from nonferrous as well and the quality of the ferrous and nonferrous is also very important because that is something you know which will ensure that it goes back in the circularity so these are things which you know might too and then coming back to your original question what nackers can do so we have our own goals of sustainability and we think that as a test agency we certainly play play can play a role in doing little bit of research and innovation in usage of these materials back into the supply chain as well as setting up maybe a center for inspection and certification which could be when a third party center established at our place okay so you know that is my my thought okay thank you thank you so much just to add to this mostly whatever is being taken from automotive industries whatever scrap is being generated from there goes to foundries where again it is remelted and sent to your automotive industries for further use so and whatever scrap is generated from any of these rvsfs or this this goes to automotive industries only because it is the best quality of material which is available and you don't have to do anything have to just remelt it and give it back to the system going ahead rvsfs are not getting material okay government is aware about it everyone is aware about it and there has been a discussion on epr extended producer's responsibility that all the oems which are working in in the country should be the part of this system ecosystem and should ensure that maximum vehicles are traveled back to rvsfs we have mister prashanthi banerjee with us executive director siam sir we need your inputs on epr what your association or on behalf of all the oems what do you think how this epr will help all the rbsfs in future thank you omar the great indian democracy and the indians right with the confundreeds that proceeds over the responsibility so this subject of vehicle's state subject whatever mandate with central government has to bring in has its own set of challenges now let's see when we started 2014 onwards in real sense this recycling business related discussion there were 7 policy documents emanating from 7 different ministries in india itself we had mister vatal then we had of course sudhir and here sudhir sitting here and then of course there is no idea here who is leading this new initiative so circular economy of the nri so basically there were in itself the material recycling will look up differently then there was a steel ministry followed by municipal transport then the plastic and used oil and the sewage so having seen that situation where everything was trying to spill down and then now with this 6 epr coming in so real change as gradually also mentioned 2021 in this may we have become up that actually set the ball rolling in real sense was responsible for what yeah and then now we have seen the 6 eprs notification rolled out by the minister of environment for us that has given a very clear where we are heading to and that's where again i'm coming back that who is responsible for what so as sudhir you very rightly said that initially the mayapuri you know stakeholders they were you know convinced that it is not against them the role of the material collector and role of the you know recycler has to have an integration with the mainline mainstream you know players so oems so when we have these very clear mandates by moef candidates here are right now discussing with them what percentage 20% or 30% and understood that we cannot achieve our sustainable one earth one family one future concept welcome and of course the climate commitments in international forum without involving mrai members scrap collectors every last on the ground you know there who is in our social fabric of circularity so this is a very good thing has happened this is something like again i'm saying that when we started in 2000 the delhi pollution committee auto fuel policy came up you know there were policy effective recommendation was latest campaign and modernization it has taken 23 years and we are still studying every auto fuel policy had this modernization garbage cash to conquer should be do and not given everybody looking that somebody else will do the initial but now at least like in emission norms everybody said it's a vehicle which is a culprit for the delhi pollution now i'm happy to tell that today expected producer response with the oem which is so it's not the explicit producer responsibility of oem which is fully responsible for taking this initiative forward and it's not a discount of perhaps the oem which is going to make the difference it is the ownership of collective ownership it's called instead of extended producer responsibility on the oem it should be shared responsibility of the entire ecosystem and that's where i believe that now gradually this misunderstanding of extended producer responsibility of polluter based the vehicle has to actually bear it but remember that vehicle is not made by oem it is made by the entire ecosystem players so therefore it's very important in my view that all of us collectively must recognize that circularity has been and had been in our impulse for centuries we just need to articulate it practice it implement it and make it happen in right awareness that's where i believe that time has come all intents are good and everybody is aligned that the future is right for us and 2025 the goal of making a developed india with a life or environment initiative of 1 of the prime minister with very clear funds all of them will lead to this so that's why i believe very hopeful that it will happen very soon we all have been discussing about it since last 2 3 years but the real challenge is what is being faced by all the r v s f's is like they are running in huge losses they don't get material on time somehow we all have to collectively come together and find best solutions for this and i understand sayam as one of the main player in this field that how and how the automotive industry and how other stakeholders can make this rvsf policy successful going ahead i would request mister uddin aarang founder and chairman of omega secchi mobility sir i came to know that you are the pioneer of ev industry this ev industry right now is i'll say at a nascent stage but very soon it will be growing very fast and entire economy will be captured by evs what is your expectation from rbsf's esg and eprs this we need to understand look i think first of all you know i just got back from switzerland last week it feels like it's switzerland there's an ac blowing in here it's definitely getting us feel like i'm not missing europe right now in here so thank you for making that effect in here for all of us but let let me be clear i think that you know and you know i know you you know we've been in this journey for quite some time it's it's really exciting to see you know i'm not a pioneer i've been in this game for just a long time but ashok leyland even our good friends at maruti padukji has finally said we're coming into ev i like that you know we've we've we've got everybody in this game now but i just don't think it's just ev i think it's green energy and sustainability whether it is i i saw when i came has a hydrogen car yeah i i think you know so so i think green energy and sustainability is extremely important to our nation you know i think that blaming each other i mean what happens in delhi every year you know we just blame punjab punjab blames haryana haryana blames everybody's blaming each other but actually we've got to do something and i think it recycle i'll tell you one thing recycling is whether it is with battery whether it's with vehicles it's the biggest business of the future i think it's even bigger than i think i think we've all got to make sure that we all get together and build a country we have a you know sir you've heard me before i think the opportunity of a lifetime is available in this nation right now i think it's one of the most you know from where i see i was a hedge fund manager for 30 years so super chance see i think you know we've got and i cannot always say what can the government you know we will always say government vdiyok's doing a super job i mean you know in a country like ours if you see what is happening i think we've all got to combine forces you know whether it is you know the large players whether it is new startups whether it is you know you know you know players that are all across this field have to combine for and i think that at least for me battery recycling you know there's gonna be a huge issue coming up you know we've got 3 4 years now 4 years of where evs are now you know with play and i don't think i don't want them dump dumped in some backyard we've got to have recycling there we've got see i i i you know we've had ev policies i spent a lot of time in the united states even in i'll tell you thailand they had a recycling policy of vehicles and people can i i think you've got to be able to be consistent and and so then ajay this is something that i'm continuously saying we cannot make policies and dillydally i'm sorry it's happening here too we make a policy somebody violates then we stop then we go businessmen and investors don't like a continuous change in policy in the us uncle joe biden's handing out money left right center and it's not gonna happen in india right i just wanna have a policy which says we're gonna do this and we're gonna stay consistent we're not gonna change if somebody just blows a red light doesn't mean we're all bad so i think for this policy recycling policy for all of this to happen 2 things needs to happen we all gotta work together okay this is our country this is our nation right we owe it to the future of this you know all of all of you know we we we're a bit older i wanna see all the young guys and girls sit in the back especially the women of this country i wanna see but what i'm saying is that we've got to work together and i think this is the need of the hour and we can't expect this the government to do everything we all got to combine forces together thank you very much see the main intention of bringing the rbs of policy was to bring all the material back formally in the business it was recycling was happening prior also all the vehicles were dismantled but not in a responsible way rbsfs are being promoted to do this recycling in a more responsible and appropriate way but i but somehow now we feel from government's mandate that you don't we have come up with this policy rvs of policy but you don't touch the informal sector this is impacting us this is impacting all the rbsfs i i am not into this business i am the secretary general of mrei i can say it very loudly but that all the rbsfs which are into this business are facing real challenges 85 of them have registered 40 of them have only into the business and rest 40 these are like sitting and watching when we will get the clear mandate and when we will start this business my question next speaker mister rahul bhatiji executive director corporate planning government affair marthu sujuki sir what is your say on epr first and second we have maruti has also come into rbsfs and what kind of challenges maruti is facing in its rbs subdivisions we'll would like to understand this from you sir thank you first of all we are extremely honored to have sri sudhendu soodendu's synergy with us i think the if tomorrow india reaches some great electrification milestones there is one personality that india will think back this is from niti aayog mister sudhendu sinha and trust me the the whole electrification journey which he is driving in india is a far bigger challenge than scaling up recycling in the country there is so it's a far smaller problem honestly it is a challenge we have our vsfs we have invested in them they are highly underutilized but we are not too scared about it we plan to do more investments because we have some confidence that this is the future it will happen it needs some interventions now mister sena sena very you know very humbly with a lot of modesty said i have come to listen so as an entrepreneur who struggles on the blueprint of how can i make it scalable there are very specific interventions until now most of the discourse has been on concepts i would come to very specifics i think the fundamental of there are 3 major pillars 1 is rbsf to be done in a modern way and the way that with innovation like doctor manish jaisal mentioned so we have rbsfs which address nuclear oil gas all kinds of liquids you know battery fluid everything lithium ion catalytic converter everything we recycle and we do it in a scientific manner and i believe i also believe that the mayapuri or the unorganized sector is not a challenge there will be a time i can tell you there will be a time then when they'll come to auto companies and say sir your business is making cars we will do it in the most modern manner you need not worry about it leave this to us that will be the time they'll ask for it and they'll modern they'll get incentivized to get modern and scientific the issue is when we make a car or a a vehicle in the factory we make it full i mean all quality standards technology etcetera full spec but when it goes into the market for in used vehicle there is no regulation as of now the first regulate whether the row whether the brakes are in order whether the emission is in order whether the head lights are in order nobody has a way of checking and assuring the roadworthiness of the vehicle so first of all this has to be addressed if we have a health based scrapping system where after regular intervals we have an inc regime doctor manish jaiswal touched upon it the fund the pillar the fundamental foundation for rvsa is an inc regime inspection and certification so we need to test the cars at regular intervals to see whether it is road worthy or not and there are sufficient cmvr tests to address whether they are what are the recommended health based checks suppose a vehicle is found is tested and found to be unfit i believe the owner of the car should get abundant opportunity to rectify the car and retest it twice thrice sufficient opportunity he should get because it's an asset which he has bought with his hard earned money now once suppose it is road worthy well and good if not then it should be compulsorily scrapped and recycled and he should need a ct and deregistered from wahan that element as of now a small beginning has been made of but that beginning is we have to test it in once in 15 years 15 years is too long period so we have to do it something like 4322 or 5211 or something like that for taxis etcetera that norm exists but for a large number of private vehicles it does not exist so this system has to be done now why is the inc regime not taking off so we went we you know in in our quality we asked 5 whys why is it not happening why is it not happening so the next intervention that we realize is that there are some very difficult conditions the government i'm sure they'll be struggling to have economic viability on it so if if the government has a bit of trust on the private sector and like many other countries almost 10 big countries us many in europe japan if they allow oems to operate through their dealers to have i and c centers the issue of land availability the issue of scalability the issue of expertise none of them will be there overnight we can create capacity for you know testing as per as per what the government norms are now i'll discuss another topic which is slightly done in hush-hush but i'll talk about it openly there is a concept of conflict of interest conflict of interest means suppose the dealer does something unethical either he says a bad he certifies a bad car as good or a good car as bad my so therefore there's a lot of fear in the government what if this happens my submission is you can simply you know dispel your fears put the responsibility on the oems we are happy to take that responsibility and ensure that the dealer does not play hanky panky he is honest i would also like to say that the dealer you know the market is also a regulator the market also for example if electrification is delayed so or if some technology somebody is not bringing the market will force so the market is also a regulator if the dealer loses reputation once he will lose his own customers also for all times to come and as a second check we are also there to ensure that such dealers get heavy penalties or are kicked out if if they if they play hanky panky so the moment we do that then you know the dealer will be able to certify and the cost is very low something like 650 rupees or something per inspection and the infrastructure the expertise the operation standards they are all on track so if the if we use that infrastructure for inspection and certification the cars can be certified good or bad bad test them again give the onerat opportunity if still after 2 or 3 sufficient trials not give it to the rbsf and the rbsf will expand you also asked about a question on epr see the first thing we have to realize is once we have sold a car to a customer he's the own legal owner of the car he has absolute right what he does with his car of course within the laws of the land so putting a responsibility on oems is slightly there's a legal disconnect in that we will be happy to put up and scale up rbsfs and we know that since they are viable in countries they can be made viable in india also and we will make them viable we we have an expansion plan despite the underutilization by the way so sorry i missed i missed the flow so these rbsfs can make themselves viable on this flow honestly this is one area where neither the government nor the private sector needs to have any kind of subsidy or financial burden on it and of course there's a shared responsibility we'll be happy to put up more rbsfs the the fundamentals have to be right the inc regime has to be put in place for that they have to allow existing infrastructure with some checks and balances to to operate in inc centers and the system will flow on it have cng we have the lithium ion all the elements when they are brought to their you know back to their original the mix with their original form it does not matter whether that ferrous after smelter is used in construction industry or in auto industry or whichever industry it is generic for for all sectors that can avail of that material raw material putting a number that the new car manufactured should have minimum some recycle content can be extremely risky because the quality requirements and the new technology requirements particularly with electrification and you know the the c o 2 the than 10 than 10% putting an astronomical number or an unrealistic number there will not help you know will not help make up for something that is missing in the ecosystem and the missing element is inc that is our submission and i'll be happy to answer any things in the proposed ecosystem that anybody can have any doubt upon thank you thank you so much for such a elaborate views on various things i will take up one i was attending a conference of bir bureau of international recycling and i was talking to the secretary general of eurek european union recycling federation i was talking to him whether a a oem can be a r v s f because in india this is happening in his view in european situations this is not the thing oem cannot be an rbsf there are high chances of conflict of interest but in our country this is happening and how government is going to take this ahead let us leave it on them my next question is to mister rishpal sachar corporate affairs sir what is your expectation from vehicle scrapping policy esg and epr please sir hello firstly i can see kind of worry you have in terms of vehicles adequate vehicles are not coming yeah so i have a good news for you we about 2 months before celebrated our 75th year of anniversary we have a huge unit in operations and i'm happy to know that today that you are providing a single platform wherein we can interact with almost all 40 rbsf available otherwise with the task force we were meeting last month it was going to patna some 6 of them so thank you first of all for that and second thanks rather i would like to share with some of the rbsf available here the 3 firstly we are keen secondly we can even invest if some of you we can put some equity also we are not going on our own to begin with and we have a lot of strength we can also help you in upgrading your infrastructure so maybe this will reduce your worry to a bit okay so now coming to business i was thinking you know while the discussion was there and we also discussed internally i see the mathematics like this there are about 2.2 crore vehicles and there are 40 odd as of now available running rbsfs so no if i say 4 piece so product is available many of those centers are world class 1 no are set up by mncs they're world class but in terms of promotion there's hardly anything there's hardly anything if i say there must be i guess something like 2,000 housing societies in delhi alone i have never seen a single rbsf any of the housing apartments that you how many vehicles you have not even a single letter because i happen to you know be a leader in that kind of mc or other things so if you have being a leader of course as of now you're a victim you're not getting enough numbers but there are efforts also likewise we as a nation produce close to 80 to 90 lakhs graduates a year each year there are also there in 1st year 2nd year if i just want to hire 20 to 50 1,000 volunteers they can be paid some fixed and some variable salaries you can have 20,000 volunteers prepared for decades they can talk about good things of this this is not only numbers this not a business but it also has lot of social activities attached those kind of things are not getting spread we as siam can help you also from our side it is not only siam acma fada such all things can now support you in taking it further besides i would also like to make one request we as an organization we feel that by 2030 we want to become 100% renewable energy re kind of working in our plants by 2048 net 0 there are esc also now being discussed in various forums so circularity and these actions can also be linked to esg so that it can go a longer way in securing by different organizations those kind of things and we will work in terms of epr those kind of numbers we all wish that our nation becomes a like a developed nation by 2047 we all want to put our efforts and again repeating that you have today 50 but if there are other aspirants please connect us all in one go sure we can have a tie up and it can save time sure thank you once again thank you thank you so much mister yaspal sachar you have really touched upon the main thing which is the awareness in one of our conferences mstc chairman was there he told our president mister sanjay policies in place sir you have funds also why don't you promote rbsfs through social medias so my small request to all the rvsfs present here please make your social hit social media handles be be it on linkedin twitter instagram post as much as you can about this rvsf policies and benefits what people a common person can get this will really help yeah local media as well this will really help not very soon but yes in years to come i never wanted to talk about it but okay i myself has taken lead in arranging some of the scars getting scrapped at rbs that's great it's easy to say but you know when you will call them yeah they will give you some 8 10 list of things you should have if you go to mayapuri who are your current kind of also competitors they are available they will help you in executing but while if you will call rbsf they will give you a kind of i will not say a kind of thing this kind of thing 8 things you require yes if you have 7 no i cannot come and pick your car is working they will ask you things like how not to how to say no i cannot pick so that also approach has to change sure that way is a kind of small feedback for you thank you so much i think all the rvs have present here would have taken note of this and will really put their comments going ahead i would request mister yasodhan ramtekji cofounder of blokon and blokchain he's an esg expert maybe take your views on the topic hi so now we understand that when understand that when our research are doing this activity they are definitely helping sustainability and are achieving esg goals one of the challenges was can we actually measure this esg goals or what is the kind of data which they are collecting what is kind of impact that actually eag impact which they have on the current environment so mmc actually took this challenge and as was mentioned by the time back so there are about 40 data points which are generated when a car a vehicle comes to rdsm and these data points help us actually to understand the and the impact when a car is actually scrapped so once a vehicle comes to a facility we mmcn along with iit bombay has come up with the algorithm which is again based on un cdm where for a 1 ton of car nearly 0.6 tons of car worth credit is generated now this data points are there and we took help of hedera hedera is a global blockchain so all these data points are put on hedera and once all these data points are there they are validated the validation is done by something called as dmrb that is digital measurement reporting and verification all these data points are completely trustworthy transparent and traceable so all data points can be traced back to the vehicle which goes there and the mrvs done by the normal like cds and all and based on this we have created a new asset class called as env credits so each vehicle has that yearly credit and each yearly credit is backed by the carbon saving on that for that area that carbon saving and it is tokenized and available for any organizations which want to have net zero impact and as pk values are saying that when you want most of the companies are looking at net zero goals and they want to have data which they can trust which is traceable and which has complete transparency so now mmcf as a platform is giving that kind of traceability transparency to each eob credit which is generated and which has a impact of carbon emission reductions directly so rbss also can will be help will be help to bridge their viability gap by taking help of these credits which can be sold on the market thank you thank you so much i have a question is this the first kind of blockchain technology you are using or this is being used in another part in some part of the world so for this is our we'll learn that this is the first time this technology is being used in india because we have cds where all the elbs can be traced back to the origin and the cds there are a lot of validations which already goes when the cd is generated so if we know the carbon market the esg market most of the carbon credits which are generated are future future generated so this is the first asset which is being generated in real time so once the car comes to the facility for scrapping and it is scrapped and the cd generated at the same time we are minting the token which is the carbon credit that token will be in the world where we are doing that that token will be tradable that token is tradable and it is they are on hedera blockchain hedera yes okay thank you so much now we open the forum for the audiences if you have any questions yeah please please go ahead please introduce yourself and hi sir good afternoon okay i'll just say 2 3 points there are list of 14 points i've already submitted to transport ministry ahmed sir gadkari saab and piyush sir everyone but quickly i'll just tell you you're talking about testing okay so the testing should obviously be like how bharti sir said that should be 2 years 5 years 3 years but there has to be age define in india if you don't define a age this pos policy will not pick up whether it's 25 years whether it's 30 years you decide you will be the right judge but there has to be age defined and for for the the fitness test you should make it compulsory and you should make sure you should put a application where i think this is my idea is the insurance of the vehicle or the third party insurance is not valid unless the certificate is valid so what will happen if the certificate for fails or goes is just laps every year if he hits the car there's no insurance because then 3rd party insurance is a insurance which has been given for a healthy vehicle not for an unfit vehicle so so it should be lapsed that should be your i think how you should take it forward i think it's a good idea otherwise i'll i'll share you the list of 14 points 15 points i have i'll exchange your email id and i'll do that sir thank you so much sir thank you so much andrew policy of elb you know in the evh we have a problem that a consumer to handle rc rgs portfolio for material consumer is not aware right so what is the definition in this policy for a consumer which was lacking in ebs and other other examples also so i would like to know that if at all outside the meeting you can share the second point is sir we're talking about you know scrapping of vehicles but why not brands are coming up none of the brands have come up with saying that circularity in their vehicles what are you looking for are you looking at 20% in your brand both you have the r and d of this material which is safety critical which is not safety critical help the start up so that we can help join hands and innovate the products and that's how we can move into circularity but automotive sector i've heard recently volvo saying i'm making my leather instead of leather seats i'm making from pork so this is the innovation we're talking about the high end one throat of cars but what are the basic car what we're making what are we doing sir client in that and the third point is sir so i do is like a complaint to the brands you said you have a lot of service stations i work with you know general waste management you please go and ask your service stations what are they doing with their used oil based the white guys the car guys they are branded right you ask them i can tell you you will i think you have got the answer what they are doing with that so none of this you know hazardous waste which is presently hazardous waste we're not able responsible it is not only the oems yeah i have got a point to see no it sounds good yeah see the point is that if i we could just have a composition of these points yeah yeah clear that so probably if this forum can of these points yeah yeah to clear that so probably if this forum can work for that it's not don't promise that i am going to solve all of them no some of them are so fundamental that that will call for i mean completely overhauling the constitution of india so we won't that but yes some of them do seem to be doable so if you could have a list of and maybe that we set up a small kind of sell or kind of a team that can work so hard on a continuous basis goes to the insurance people and tries to find out how exactly we work on the policy front across the globe we operate among 80 epr scheme throughout the world we hope you're in a way american states and so the question is in the 100 right when we say we would exclude that huge mass of the risk managers how the policy would actually look right if we would not include them then there are chances of the fridge of the components of the electron or any vehicle right we have catalytic converter which holds a huge value and which can go into the gray area market then similarly the next point is recycled content with the discharge upon according to the report by european union on the automobile front there is a possibility to have 28 to 30% recycled content not only high performance components of a battery electronic meter but the secondary components which likely starts from the small small parts which do not hinder the performance so this can be looked upon the targets to have a recycled content can be discussed by the oems along with their qualities that's where the actual component would come in next is ebr target i believe roman was talking about ebr targets epr is not about using a recycled content epr is about what you will product you are putting into the market you have a responsibility to recycle right being a responsible brand owner and i heard one argument which was coming up why oems and brand owners should be liable to do this epr target and it should be a shared responsibility yes it is a shared responsibility the epr principally says polluter pays by saying this polluter pays what exactly they mean is at the end of the product consumer has paid a certain nominal notional value of a product to the oems and it becomes the responsibility of the oem to ensure that they collect it because they have the right infrastructure they have taken up a commercial value order and then the second point was circularity at present right now by 2023 according to the world economic forum we are utilizing earth's resources by 600 times that means earth cannot regenerate the resources what we are doing right that's where the circularity has to come in and when we see having a circularity and using a recycled quantity to it it should come back into the mainstream economy of the same composite material having the offset of recycled quantity they go different fields might be a waste so this point of circularity has to be looked upon and from the investors perspective of the companies who are in infrastructure space accordingly so we should have a framework which is robust which is consistent and then only the transition risk of any business can be solved well i have couple of more maybe we can get later thank you thank you i would like to thank all these panelists for their time and as few of my members said with the help of siem mrai mrai is coming up with national forum or a national body basically looking after all the challenges being faced by rvss so collectively we can represent at various central and state level government and put our issues and suggestions forward so that all the challenges being faced by rbsfs are taken well and our business get flourished sir very soon from our mrai team we will submit all the submissions yeah thank you i just i just wanna say one thing you know i maybe you'll agree with me i have never seen an audience this passionate and this smart this intelligent honestly i'm impressed i really am and you guys have put in a really i mean the questions and the and how people care i know we run out of time we really need to thank this audience it's absolutely amazing in my in my book thank you very much thank you so much everyone thank you",

        "name": "Special Addresses by Shri N Mohan\u29f8Delhi EV Cell \uff5c Can the EV Sector be India\u2019s Next Growth Engine\uff1f",
        "content": "now the best person to speak on daily's experience and journey is sri n mohan sir who is the chief executive officer of delhi ebc transport department at government of ncd sir over to you so good morning everyone so thank you thank you industry of industries and policy time for this opportunity so theme of this seminar is like can the use of india's next growth engine the answer is yes the reason being if you look at the remote journey maybe like come and see from 2015 onwards and the fame 2 was launched subsequently we had fame fame 1 was launched 2019 we had fame 2 program so at the national level there is like fame 1 and fame 2 which initiated the initial impetus for mobile the industry at a subnational level states start raising up the electric vehicle policy so delhi also is one state which had a comprehensive electric mobility policy which was in august 2020 so we'll be completing 3 years in this current year so we had a series of experience in terms of like how the the mobility has been increasing the in the at the state level especially it come to transportation sector the close to 16% of the regular emissions are from road transport so this is a clear indication that yes there's a need to decommission the transport sector and one of the way of doing it is by inducting more electric vehicles so the state policy also clearing these ambitions where in daily we have an ambition of having 25% electric vehicle sales by 2024 so there's status subnational we have a target in place currently if you look at our 3 years of journey so when we start this 2020 the ev policy the initially the 1st year we had an option from 2.5% subsequently it increased to 5.7% and the last year it had around close to 10.2% so currently we are close on 12% of the year registration all vehicle segment is concerned so lastly the lease in mass segment for 2 less than 3 less that is what we represent and subsequently we had 4 less to select marginally less important but our main focus is to elect it for the 2 and 3 villas per segment under the policy framework we're also providing the purchase incentive when i say purchase incentive it would typically provide a kind of an incentive for each segment of electric vehicles which is more aligned to the frame 2 policy so in delhi like typically you brought around 5,000 rupees per kilowatt around the tubeless segment and the maximum of the 30,000 rupees per vehicle the same is for the tubeless segment also so this has given a kind of an a kind of an comfort to the customers to buy electric vehicles because the cost of electric vehicles are high as compared to the ic counterpart so this kind of policy and demand instantly will help customers to acquire the electric electric vehicles by having by offsetting those initial upfront cost in the in the particular category lastly if you look at the 2022 ev penetration in delhi especially the 3 wheeler coupe segment is concerned also 65% of the electric 65% of the vehicles sold in the 3 wheeler boots equity is retrofit it means out of 100 vehicles sold in delhi especially 3 wheeler goods category 65 vehicles are electric so this is strong indication that especially in the particular some some of the segments are more inclined towards adopting these electric vehicles the same updates feature the motor cap 2 in the formula segment we're touching close to 45% it's 45% of the overall vehicles sold in the motor cab by the commercial 4 4 wheeler concern are electric so these segments are picking up very fast and this has been backed by strong policy the government push and also having the strong network of ev charging station so whenever we talk about electric vehicles there's need for charging infrastructure so delhi has close to around 4,000 charging point of which around 7 slow charging points and around close to 12% are fast charging points so this is helping the ev customers to use this network of ev charging stations across multiple locations be it public locations semi public locations or the private locations so we have done some of the the key pilot also to enable the shift to public transportation also so we've done recently and study in dwarka subsidy it's more like a proof of concept or a pilot project and then we conducted electric autos for last mile connectivity services this has gained a good good traction and acceptance by the public also when people start looking for the e autos for the mobility requirement for using the public transport be it bus or be it the metro so we're on we want to more augment this particular segment for a larger cost now we want to induct an e scooters e cycles as a mode for last minute in the coming months to come if you look at the policy framework we talk about how we need to increase the the ev penetration in in delhi so we're also we'll be coming out within the policy for motor vehicle aggregators scheme i would say which is mainly applicable for the aggregators and the delivery service providers wherein will going to depend of a mandate mandate targets for inductee electric vehicles by these companies so typically the freight companies were providing the passenger transport services delivery service for us were providing services to ecommerce entities or other entities they would be covered under this bandwidth and then in the face manner they need to pin their electric vehicles in their operations so typically in the span of like 4 to 4 years time we want to ensure that all the vehicles which those such companies who in that would be electric so series of measures have been planned by in delhi to ensure that there is a transition towards the electric mobility in coming years just to let for a larger audience like how the journey was electric vehicle started out miss whatsapp clear experience from my side also if you look at like 2019 that is where we started like seeing a revolution in the direct mobility industry if you look at the frugal segment if somebody's tracking how the food has grown in over 3 years time in 2019 typically the battery capacity of this electric car is somewhat close on 17 kilowatt hour and the range was close to 1 30 kilometers for a charge so so the people had an a concern about like the range anxiety the kilometers are inadequate electric cars but if you look at the current end of electric cars the battery capacity of course of 30 kilowatt and these are going close to like 70 to 90 kilowatt of battery capacity and with the range close-up to 500 kilometers so what has increased the battery capacities has increased so is it a solution to like keep on increasing the battery faster to achieve those desired range may not be a right answer but typically i would say that initially yes we need a longer range electric vehicle so people have comfort of driving that intercity maybe like intercity also we're definitely driving driving kilometers spans 4 100 kilometers in a day mhmm so to to some extent i think the waves are able to bring such electric vehicles in the country now we have more than i think 6 or 7 oems who have launched electric vehicles in the portfolio and the range are upwards of 400 kilometers and especially in the commercial segments are concerned the acceptance has increased as compared to the private individual buyers the second the second is if you look at the 2 years 2 years of relative initially there were only 2 models for the major auto vms now we have more than like 7 or 8 models which are available to the customer so choice has increased for customers to choose the electric vehicles in the daily if you look at the number of like oems in the 2 velasquez it's more than 23 and 3 it's more than 70 if you look at in the 4 it's around like close to like 4 if you look at what is the volume numbers are increased if you look at dealer network also in delhi i think if you look at the the 3 wheeler dealers network it's more than 200 and in 2 less it's more than 131 it means like gradually there is a network of the dealership which has which has helped customers to like reach out to those oem partners and encode about electric vehicles and aqua resented vehicles so we see i think the larger oem participation is required so now i think with the industry and with such consultation this is evolving very very fast with respect to some points on the the charging series concern if you look at the 2 wheels and the rear segments are concerned we have both variants of electric vehicles we have fixed factory electric vehicles and also we have the battery sparking station bodyguards so where the vehicles comes the swappable battery with the people can at least like replace their discharge battery with the charge battery the swapping station so this has picked up largely in the commercial segment in the 2 and 3 years we see a strong value in the battery swapping stations too the reason being it is going to offset the cost of the electric vehicle as the batteries offered as a service to the end customers so this is bringing a lot of changes especially in the commercial application but in the formula is concerned i think it's still it's more about the price and the range which is which will be in determining factor for the end customers to choose so lastly when we talk about the the charging infrastructure so we are we get a lot of concern about like how this infra could be more made more reliable because initially it was more about like giving me comfort to the ev user that has so many charging parts available in and around the city but now the people look at the reliable charging network the people talk about the service level of the charging station it's more becoming a service industry the graduate electric mobility is becoming a service industry where people are looking for service and the quality output if you look at the charging station across like international level also we get a lot of complaints about the reliability the uptime the maintenance of those chargers now the time has come with industry and as i said ecosystem partners also we need to start looking like how we can at least like make this system more easily available to the public which is more convenient for them to use this facility and lastly i think the public transportation i think we're inducting electric buses i think thanks to lee tianok ministry of industry and fame too also we're operating 300 electric buses presently and we have plans to inject around close to 6,300 buses in next 3 years' time which means that presently the 4% is our the public transport is electrified but next in 3 years time close to 80% of the public transport will be electrified so this is one trying to trying to at least like join the the growth journey of electric mobility it's a beginning and maybe like for the end generation who are pursuing electric mobility as their key area or expertise against the right thing people should at least like getting to those academy and strengthen this ecosystem so with this i once again thank icad and policy times for the opportunity and look forward for the discussion thank you so much",

        "content": "hello to all the veterans here one of the benefits of epr that i can clearly say right now is that a young person like me a young recycler not only gets a stage to get all the information to get all the experience that so many people and to learn from it and also share my little experiences and my learnings from the industry and it is because of apr policies that recyclers like us micro small businesses like ours are getting a platform where we can connect with industry leaders with big brands with the eminent personalities of sustainability and with policymakers so i would really like to give a big thanks to the policy times and all the organizing partners for organizing such a good conference and giving me an opportunity to present my views and my expectations and what i see as a future because future generations what i expect from you from this generation is very important that you get to hear that and it is a pleasure that i get to share what little achievements my organization some of these solutions has been able to make to start with the achievements so it's a really different claim that we make that sitting in delhi we climbed mount everest 45 times in 1 year so definitely how 45 times declined the mount everest so we collect thermal coal waste and we are able to push consumer and push industrial waste so we collected 1 lakh 80,000 kgs of push consumer thermal waste and we feel proud to be one of the pioneer recycling company in thermal recycling so if we take an average weight of 1.5 feet tall thermal coal piece that would weigh around 200 grams so you know if we do some calculations we find of 1 lakh 80,000 kgs of thermocol is tagged 1 on another it would be 45 times of mount everest so just a city like delhi if there was no recycling happening the thermocol would have another 45 mountains of garbage so this is the quantum that we are looking at and what happens with thermocol so we are very glad that we have been able to produce granules having mechanical properties up to their virgin counterparts so these granules can be used along with virgin gpps granules most of you must have received the brochure of microgartics industries this shows that the properties of recycled granules are as far as good as a virgin and in terms of material flow index it's better than the virgin plastic so we have been working with many heavy industries and now we are on a stage to build the range of recycled plastic products one of the very big achievement that we are looking for this year is that earlier thermocol is being used as a packaging for refrigerator now we are in r and d that it will be used as a part these banners made out of recycling of thermocol will be used to make the body stacker in a refrigerator so thermocol will be going through story of being outside thermal coal now it will outside of a refrigerator now it will be inside the refrigerator so that is the achievement that we are able to make and it is because of the epr policy that big brands are here sitting on a table with us listening to us and it has been you know the government's push which is even making this happen i'm really thankful to all the state pollution control boards the central pollution control boards and to our prime minister for giving slogans like swach bharat and you know atmelnypa bharat it is because of the atmelnypa bharat that the plastic recycling industry is also becoming because now we are able to sell recycle will be there until and unless there is a new economy or new so recycled product is not making an economic sense there won't be any environmental good that we'll be able to do and i remember you know i this is a very emotional thing for me this event because it seems like i've completed a small circle when i joined my business with my father's dad or my father's business we received a call from genenviro they have a recycling plant in kanto so in the process of making yarn we were generating thermal waste it wasn't kanpur and so they they were generating thermal waste so they they did some research online and they were the only organization they could find who are recycling thermocol so big thanks to the gem enviro and tell you to them that they transported their from so that is it's free to do for a company and today when i shared the stage and you know this august meeting with the representatives from gem enviro it and definitely i head the operations and sales of my company so i'm always the salesperson so definitely there are i can see people who have the say in manufacturing industries i would request them to put a a story that more and more companies should come up with recycled granular product because only if revenues from our product would come then we will be able to grow we are thankful to the grants that we get from epr but that is not a sustainable model for long term the revenues when they come from sales of our products that is when we become atmanirbhar thank you so much",

        "content": "good afternoon respected panelist on the dais and ladies and gentlemen who are doing extremely important work in the field of recycling with the all hours initially we started with 3 hour but today it has gone to 10 hour so i don't know how many hours would come but the most important aspect is how best we do first at ourselves then the organization and therefore the society and that is what today is a 1 recycle day and we all came to celebrate here but i think celebration will be always showing practice and more more practicing than preaching and that is what i think changed the world where we are today i'm thankful to the organization especially this time csr times for inviting me here to share a few of my thoughts as morning we heard that epr largely it is all about environment climate change plastic and everything so i wouldn't go into more detail because we all are aware but i would like to specifically highlight some of the initiative actions that we as agua pollution control board have started as agua state has started with active support from government now 2 things emerged 1 is a warning they said leaders he was talking about the proactive leader who could do something and i would like to start see initially a go to mission control board is what is and then one highlight you will see that the municipal solid waste which are all practicing in 2016 but the one leader we had i would say unfortunately we had with mister manur parikhar for the chief minister of goa and we all raksha mantri who started this goa non bifidural garbage control act in 1996 when he became a first time chief minister so he did that and that is a way forward for taking this waste management and i'll tell you we have a department of waste management we have minister of waste management and we have minister for waste management that is started 1996 so that is a leader can make a difference and then and that is what the forthcoming foresight we had for doing this now really i've at this forum i would say there is something which had to be emulated and and that led to the many initiative which subsequent leaders subsequent followers took it forward then you see here so once we're doing that what is it what is the circular economy so epr yep what a state could do with the leadership with the again i'm saying leadership number 2 is a networking and collective responsibility it's not a one individual cannot make a difference like all of us are here together to make difference and contribute individually whatever best we can so we started this work with european union and giz and giz and gol was the 1st state to come with the circular economy policy that was we did together and in that there were identified 3 categories which are required to be focused as a go as a state 1 building and construction waste which we are talking about 2nd marine litter because we have a coastal state and a lot of fishing nets were going on and 3rd is plastic waste management marine litter and plastic waste and 3rd you can say together or the tourism was you all must have gone to the tourist in goa we get 4 times our population floating tourists floating population what you call and what are they come to enjoy environment god bless a state like ours with western heart and the seashore but while going i'm not saying going unknowingly whatever the meter is a barefoot environment and number 2 next to this crew comes we're not able to enjoy that so that is a big challenge for us because after closing our mining tourism is a biggest economic activity of a small state like war and that is what we started as a policy for circular economy probably covid times 2 3 weeks we could wait but we started doing that on a larger scale just 2 years back after and again i would say it's a collective effort gsi european union and perry came together and we did first program on a fishnet recycling a fishnet recycling is comprehensive efforts we made with the fisheries department with the municipality train you see the iec activity where we're talking about all the time doesn't help you know rules are there but difficult to implement the state like india where we have wide population different segment segment difficult so it's best to get along and do it and i'm happy that we were able to make a pilot project very successful for the fishnet now imagine the fishing community they would just go fish and come waste net they'll just throw it out they're aware they entangle the fish there are a lot of turtle nesting sites they can integrate turtle they're ghost nest however they do not never have any person to collect it back if they get money suddenly they'll get it back number 2 even certain places there was no place to store that's finally storage it depends money you see you got a space so we fisheries department come together and we identified a storage space for all fishnets we identified also through our gis and european union especially i want to mention here archana archana arora from giz who took a lot of initiative doing this work we work very closely and today's the small film i'll show you based on time is only 4 minutes from which i can show you how the success project we launched during the delhi sustainable summit recently but this i'm just trying to speak with you the actual initiative that we started now plastic waste is an and you know epr rules are there my personal opinion again is is good is when but the rules that alone doesn't help and that's what you see if if all rules were very clearly implemented we would have not seen so much plastic bottles cans and single use plastic better not to speak here we find all the roadside but there are rules but there are problem in implementation so what we want to do is we saw something different we can can we think of and we thought of doing like something like deposit refund scheme scheme again is many of you go to europe and you find you buy a water bottle few cents they take as a deposit and refund it that's successful i think germany all 80 90% they get it in scandinavian countries up to 90% but because there is incentive money i'll just tell you background also when i started to in fact this was my initiative supported very closely by our honorable chief minister sir mohammad sawan and my non prime minister who said all technical you can take forward and that proactive government again legacy of mister padikar ji because today the whatever the waste management plant which was started as a waste management corporation again we have a waste management corporation exclusively to dell waste management and that is basically solid waste management but however all mixed waste is to come because we have a lot of hotel in this so here just a background if you have some of you going to go up maybe 9 or it is you buy a beer and they will take 2 rupees deposit for a beer bottle so once your beer is over you just return it back and they'll refund you 2 years 2 years back i was wondering why does it why this was not practiced later so we have put an ngo to study as an incognito because people don't give proper answer and we realized that we have only you know only one brand kingfisher today we have 10 brands so everybody has his own marketing kingfisher had and we are talking about reverse logistics kingfisher has a factory in goa and they were also collecting bottles back under boschini brands came so do not have the facility reverse logistic that we're talking is a very costly we should appreciate it number 2 the what dealer k so they require a space to keep this empty bottle however you see the dynamic market changes kingfisher could dictate them but they are only the sole supplier so later retailers started dictating them if you want to keep me bottle back and buy i will not sell you so i'll sell other models so then the market dynamics change so then we got this we said we cannot reintroduce the scheme same way as it was so what we do next time is we made a survey market survey and got the people to implement think what if you do a different skin how does it work it is simple i think i'll show you it's a 60 second film that will explain you much better but how about the process what we have started thinking is let's make that the product reforms scheme implementable we just do not want to copy western model at the same time we do not want to copy what we are doing earlier so the first step was to amend the biodegradable act which made 1996 but that was done so last assembly we amended the act for biodegradable water solid waste management act and included other aspect like there was there was concentration focus on really solid we spill solid waste but here we set plastic cans tetra pack i'm going to work what you call that shampoo bottles on what you call that particular type s s d p yeah all that was included so amended the act after amend amending the act we also try to study what's the best possible way here is a scheme under an indian model the honorable prime minister but we by 2,047 i think we cannot copy a western model of just doing because it and don't create they had a problem we need to realize early and how to come out of it so in europe if you go there there is a you deposit but you have to go to a place where you have to deposit as a reverse vending machine i think indian context is very difficult i'm very happy that collectivism or but i'm complimented petroleum companies like i will see hbcl bpcl when i spoke with them they came forward these are all petrol pump one small space so where there'll be a collection point that's 1 number 2 but still then many people will not venture to go there so another system we are thinking of like our qr code linked to your upi so whatever deposit you get you pay you don't have to go to the bare bottom you have to go to the same vendor today you don't have to go there that's what they're thinking you anywhere you go just scan your with a mobile code and you will get your deposit back but only you have to deposit a particular place so so in this process we are thinking as we are talking about the quantity you are getting in you are if you are all brand will get their plastic your metal your tetra pak everything will come with a 1 plus so it is in segregated format people will go through it out but the incentive for the taxi drivers which i'm doing for one context taxi driver will not allow passenger bills if he collects and goes he can collect the 2 rupees 5 rupees so that will incentive for everybody to do it back environment is 1 but i personally believe economists will override as always environment so incorporate economics area that is important environment you embed into that economics so this is a model we are thinking of this one i'll show you shortly you're also stakeholder now that is also a question based in fact i'm very happy like we care is a association it of plastic manufacturers they came so gogresh took a lot of initiative it's a gogresh doing and i always want to acknowledge who come forward into good work gogresh came first time and i heard also sampoorn is one of the partner here sampoorn was just doing some work in goa they were supported by coca cola initially but when the epr came they stopped when progress came forward i appealed to them and they are tired of they're doing 3 municipal waste iec activity and 30 village panchay that project led to also making them as a partner in identifying what could be a role of this scrap dealers or garbage what do you call it hand pickers so we have in fact that is an interesting case study when in future something people can play they have said that in how to get informal sector into the formal sector and there's a good economic model this case is also is printed in detail case study so they came and did it so in the in the process also we asked gri and giz and you support a project for doing people perception study how much should we deposit per quarter and interestingly all tourists gave a very low number but local governments give such a big number which i would i won't disclose this number because we have no starter yet big number they said our environment will preserve let them charge heavy let you collect and take it back and we thought in this process everyone will benefit it because garbage credit so we released this stur report study in the season we went also next step was to know incorporate how to take this forward so it is a pollution control code department of environment and i told you special purpose vehicle called goa waste management plant corporation which has a 2 state of the art waste management plant waste to energy we are collecting the whole thing so where the 3 3 agencies put together so my role is a regulator but we are having only finding these small tests or panchayat for not implementing i think that these are good i've been not there but today we have come together and we have a client so my end submission is yes some rules are made with a good intention well i also get a lot of people saying their epr code is not working it's not down we are not able to upload so i spend a lot of time in answering those queries for the api however we can rethink beyond and can get all stakeholders in learning process we go on changing more importantly with this i wouldn't take time thank you very much",
